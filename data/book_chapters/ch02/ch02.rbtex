You'd probably like to be able to drive your car and light your apartment
without having to pay money for gas and electricity, and if you do a little
websurfing, you can easily find people who say they have the solution to
your problem. This kind of scam has been around for centuries. It used to be
known as a perpetual motion machine,\index{perpetual motion machine}
but nowadays the con artists' preferred phrase is
``free energy.''\footnote{An entertaining account of this form of quackery
is given in \textbf{Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud}, Robert Park,
Oxford University Press, 2000. Until reading this book, I hadn't realized
the degree to which pseudoscience had penetrated otherwise respectable
scientific organizations like NASA.} A typical ``free-energy'' machine
\index{energy!``free''} would
be a sealed box that heats your house without needing to be plugged into a
wall socket or a gas pipe. Heat comes out, but nothing goes in, and this
can go on indefinitely. But an interesting thing happens if you try to check
on the advertised performance of the machine. Typically, you'll find out that
either the device is still in development, or it's back-ordered because
so many people have already taken advantage of this Fantastic Opportunity!
In a few cases, the magic box exists, but the inventor
is only willing to demonstrate very small levels of heat output for short
periods of time, in which case there's probably a tiny hearing-aid battery hidden in 
there somewhere, or some other trick.

      James Joule, 1818-1889. The son of a wealthy brewer,
              Joule was tutored as a young man by the famous scientist John Dalton.
              Fascinated by electricity, he and his
              brother experimented by giving electric shocks to each other and to the
              family's servants. Joule ran the brewery as an adult, and science was merely a
              serious hobby. His work on energy can be traced to his attempt to build
              an electric motor that would replace steam engines. His ideas
              were not accepted at first, partly because they contradicted the widespread
              belief that heat was a fluid, and partly because they depended on extremely
              precise measurements, which had not previously been common in
              physics.

        Since nobody has ever succeeded in building
        a device that creates
        heat out of nothing, we might also wonder whether any
        device exists that can do the opposite, turning heat into nothing. You might think
        that a refrigerator was such a device, but actually your refrigerator doesn't
        destroy the heat in the food. What it really does is to extract some of the heat
        and bring it out into the room. That's why it has big radiator coils on
        the back, which get hot when it's in operation.\index{heat}\index{energy!heat}

If it's not possible to destroy or create heat outright, then you might start to
suspect that heat was a conserved quantity. This would be a successful rule
for explaining certain processes, such as the transfer of heat between a cold
Martini and a room-temperature olive: if the olive loses a little heat, then
the drink must gain the same amount. It would fail in general, however.
\index{energy!light}
Sunlight can heat your skin, for example, and a hot lightbulb filament can
cool off by emitting light. Based on these observations, we could revise our
proposed conservation law, and say that there is something called heatpluslight,
which is conserved. Even this, however, needs to be generalized in order to
explain why you can get a painful burn playing baseball when you slide into
a base. Now we could call it heatpluslightplusmotion. The word is getting pretty
long, and we haven't even finished the list.

Rather than making the word longer and longer, physicists have 
hijacked the word ``energy'' from ordinary usage, and give it a new, specific
technical meaning. 
Just as the Parisian platinum-iridium kilogram defines a
specific unit of mass, we need to pick something that defines a definite
unit of energy. The metric unit of energy is the joule (J),\index{joule (unit)}
and we'll define
it as the amount of energy required to heat 0.24 grams
of water from 20 to 21 degrees Celsius.\index{Celsius scale}
(Don't memorize the numbers.)\footnote{Although
the definition refers to the Celsius scale of temperature, it's not
necessary to give an operational definition of the temperature\index{temperature}
concept
in general (which turns out to be quite a tricky thing to do completely
rigorously); we only need to establish two specific temperatures that can
be reproduced on thermometers that have been calibrated in a standard way.
Heat and temperature are discussed in more detail in section \ref{atomicphenomenasection},
and in chapter \ref{ch:thermo}. Conceptually, heat is a measure of energy, whereas
temperature relates to how concentrated that energy is.}
\index{heat!compared to temperature}\index{temperature!compared to heat}

\begin{eg}{Temperature of a mixture}
\egquestion
If 1.0 kg of water at 20\degcunit{}  is mixed with 4.0 kg of water at 30\degcunit,
what is the temperature of the mixture?

\eganswer
Let's assume as an approximation that each degree of temperature change
corresponds to the same amount of energy. In other words, we assume
$\Delta E\zu{=} mc\Delta T$, regardless of whether,
as in the definition of the joule, we have 
$\Delta T=\zu{21\degcunit{}-20\degcunit{}}$ or, as in the present example, some other
combination of initial and final temperatures.
To be consistent with
the definition of the joule, we must have
$c=\zu{(1 J)/(0.24 g)/(1\degcunit{})}$
= 4.2$\times10^3$ $\zu{J/kg}\cdot^{\circ}$$\zu{C}$,
which is referred to as the
specific heat\index{specific heat}\index{water!specific heat} of water.

Conservation of energy tells us $\Delta{} E=0$, so
\begin{equation*}
         m_1c\Delta{} T_1+ m_2c\Delta{} T_2 = 0
\end{equation*}
\noindent{}or
\begin{align*}
        \frac{\Delta{} T_1}{\Delta{} T_2} &= -\frac{ m_2}{ m_1} \\
                & = - 4.0\qquad{}.
\end{align*}
\noindent{}If $T_1$ has to change four times as much as $T_2$, and the
two final temperatures are equal, then the final temperature must be
28\degcunit{}.
\end{eg}

Note how only \emph{differences} in temperature and energy appeared in the preceding
example. In other words, we don't have to make any assumptions about
whether there is a temperature at which all an object's heat energy is
removed. Historically, the energy and temperature units were invented before
it was shown that there is such a temperature,
called absolute zero\index{absolute zero}\index{temperature!absolute zero}.
There is a scale of temperature, the Kelvin scale,\index{Kelvin scale} in which
the unit of temperature is the same as the Celsius degree,
but the zero point is defined as absolute
zero. But as long as we only deal with temperature differences, it doesn't matter
whether we use Kelvin or Celsius. Likewise, as long as we deal with differences
in heat energy, we don't normally have to worry about the total amount of heat
energy the object has. In standard physics terminology, ``heat'' is used only
to refer to differences, while the total amount is called the object's
``thermal energy.''\index{heat!compared to thermal energy}%
\index{thermal energy!compared to heat} This distinction is often
ignored by scientists in casual speech, and in this book I'll usually use ``heat'' for
either quantity.

We're defining energy by adding up things from a list, which
we lengthen as needed: heat, light,
motion, etc. One objection to this approach is aesthetic: physicists tend to regard
complication as a synonym for ugliness. If we have to keep on adding more
and more forms of energy to our laundry list, then it's starting to sound
like energy is distressingly complicated. Luckily it turns out that energy is
simpler than it seems. Many forms of energy that are apparently unrelated
turn out to be manifestations of a small number of forms at the atomic level,
and this is the topic of section \ref{atomicphenomenasection}.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Logical issues") %>

Another possible objection is that 
the open-ended approach to defining energy might seem like a kind of cheat, since
we keep on inventing new forms whenever we need them. If a certain experiment seems to
violate conservation of energy, can't we just invent a new form of invisible
``mystery energy'' that patches things up? This would be like balancing
your checkbook by putting in a fake transaction that makes your calculation
of the balance agree with your bank's. If we could fudge this way, then conservation
of energy would be untestable --- impossible to prove or disprove.

Actually all scientific theories are unprovable. A theory can never be proved,
because the experiments can
only cover a finite number out of the infinitely many situations in which the
theory is supposed to apply. Even a million experiments won't suffice to
prove it in the same sense of the word ``proof'' that is used
in mathematics. However, even one experiment that contradicts a theory is
sufficient to show that the theory is wrong. A theory that is
immune to disproof is a bad theory, because there is no way to test it. For
instance, if I say that 23 is the maximum number of angels that
can dance on the head of a pin, I haven't made a properly falsifiable
scientific theory, since there's no method by which anyone could even
attempt to prove me wrong based on observations or experiments.

\index{Joule, James!paddlewheel experiment}
Conservation of energy is testable because
new forms of energy are expected to show regular mathematical behavior,
and are supposed to be related in a measurable way to
observable phenomena. As an example, let's see how to extend the energy concept
to include motion.

<% begin_sec("Kinetic energy") %>

Energy of motion is called
\emph{kinetic energy}\index{energy!kinetic}\index{kinetic energy}.
(The root of the word is the same as the word ``cinema'' -- in French,
kinetic energy is ``\'{e}nergie cin\'{e}tique.'')
How does an object's kinetic energy depend on its mass and velocity?
Joule attempted a conceptually simple experiment on his
honeymoon in the French-Swiss Alps near Mt. Chamonix, in which
he measured the difference in temperature between the top and bottom of
a waterfall. The water at the top of the falls has some gravitational
energy, which isn't our subject right now, but as it drops, that
gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy, and then into
heat energy due to internal friction in the churning pool at the bottom:
\begin{equation*}
        \text{gravitational energy} \rightarrow \text{kinetic energy} \rightarrow \text{heat energy} 
\end{equation*}
In the logical framework of this book's presentation of energy, the
significance of the experiment is that it provides a way to find out how
an object's kinetic energy depends on its mass and velocity.
The increase in heat energy should equal the kinetic energy of the water
just before impact, so in principle we could measure the water's mass,
velocity, and kinetic energy, and see how they relate to one
another.\footnote{From Joule's point of view, the
point of the experiment was different. At that time,
most physicists believed that heat was a quantity that was conserved separately
from the rest of the things to which we now refer as energy, i.e., mechanical\        energy. Separate units
of measurement had been constructed for heat and mechanical
of energy, but Joule was trying to
show that one could convert back and forth between them, and that 
it was actually their sum that was conserved, if they were both
expressed in consistent units. His main result was the conversion factor that
would allow the two sets of units to be reconciled. By showing that the conversion
factor came out the same in different types of experiments, he was supporting
his assertion that heat was not separately conserved. From Joule's perspective or
from ours, the result is to connect the mysterious, invisible phenomenon
of heat with forms of energy that are visible properties of objects, i.e.,
mechanical energy.}

\index{paddlewheel experiment}
Although the story is picturesque and memorable, most books that mention the
experiment fail to note that it was a failure! The problem was that
heat wasn't the only form of energy being released. In reality, the
situation was more like this:
\begin{align*}
        \text{gravitational energy}  \rightarrow & \text{kinetic energy} \\
         \rightarrow & \text{heat energy} \\
                & + \text{sound energy} \\
                 & + \text{energy of partial evaporation}\eqquad.

              same amount of kinetic energy. Was some energy destroyed? No.

Whenever you encounter an equation like this for the first time, you should get
in the habit of interpreting it. First off, we can tell that by making the mass or
velocity greater, we'd get more kinetic energy. That makes sense. Notice,
however, that we have mass to the first power, but velocity to the second.
Having the whole thing proportional to mass to the first power is necessary
on theoretical grounds, since energy is supposed to be additive.
The dependence on $v^2$ couldn't have been predicted, but it is sensible.
For instance, suppose we reverse the direction of motion. This would reverse
the sign of $v$, because in one dimension we use positive and negative signs
to indicate the direction of motion. But since $v^2$ is what appears in the
equation, the resulting kinetic energy is unchanged.

What about the factor
of 1/2 in front? It comes out to be exactly 1/2 by the design of the metric system.
If we'd been using the old-fashioned British engineering system of units
(which is no longer used in the U.K.), the equation would have been
$K=(7.44\times10^{-2}\ \myunit{Btu}\cdot\sunit^2/\myunit{slug}\cdot\myunit{ft}^2)mv^2$.
The version of the metric system called the
SI,\footnote{Syst\`eme International}\index{SI units} in which everything is based
on units of kilograms, meters, and seconds, not only has the numerical constant
equal to 1/2, but makes it unitless as well. In other words, we can think of
the joule as simply an abbreviation, 1 J=1 $\kgunit\cdot\munit^2/\sunit^2$.
More familiar examples of this type of abbreviation are 1 minute=60 s,
and the metric unit of land area, 1 hectare=$10000\ \munit^2$.

\begin{eg}{Ergs and joules}
\egquestion
There used to be two commonly used systems of metric units, referred to as
mks and cgs. The mks system, now called the SI, is based on the meter, the
kilogram, and the second. The cgs system, which is now obsolete, was based
on the centimeter, the gram, and the second. In the cgs system, the unit of
energy is not the joule but the erg,\index{erg (unit)}
1 erg=1 $\myunit{g}\cdot\myunit{cm}^2/\myunit{s}^2$. How many ergs are in
one joule?

\eganswer
        The simplest approach is to treat the units as if they were algebra symbols.
        \begin{align*}
                \zu{1 J}        &=         1\ \frac{\zu{kg}\cdot\zu{m}^2}{\zu{s}^2} \\
                                        &=        1\ \frac{\zu{kg}\cdot\zu{m}^2}{\zu{s}^2}

                                        &=        10^7\ \frac{\zu{g}\cdot\zu{cm}^2}{\zu{s}^2} \\

\begin{eg}{Cabin air in a jet airplane}
\egquestion
        A jet airplane typically cruises at a velocity of 270 m/s. Outside air is
        continuously pumped into the cabin, but must be cooled off first, both because (1) it
        heats up due to friction as it enters the engines, and (2) it is heated
        as a side-effect of being compressed to cabin pressure. Calculate the
        increase in temperature due to the first effect. The specific heat of dry
        air is about 1.0$\times10^3$ $\zu{J/kg}\cdot^{\circ}$$\zu{C}$.

\eganswer
        This is easiest to understand in the frame of reference of the plane,
        in which the air rushing into the engine is stopped, and its
        kinetic energy converted into heat.\footnote{It's not at all obvious that
        the solution would work out in the earth's frame of reference, although
        Galilean relativity states that it doesn't matter which frame we use. Chapter
        \ref{ch:3} discusses the relationship between conservation of energy and
        Galilean relativity.}
         Conservation of energy tells us
        \begin{align*}
                0        &=        \Delta{} E \\
                                &=        \Delta{} K+\Delta{} E_{heat}\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        In the plane's frame of reference, the air's initial velocity is
        $v_i$=270 m/s, and its final velocity is zero, so the change
        in its kinetic energy is negative,
        \begin{align*}
                \Delta{} K        &=         K_{f} -  K_{i} \\
                                        &=        0-\zu{(1/2)} m{ v_{i}}^2 \\
                                        &=        -\zu{(1/2)} m{ v_i}^2\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        Assuming that the specific heat of air is roughly independent of
        temperature (which is why the number was stated with the word
        ``about''), we can substitute into
        $0 = \Delta{} K+\Delta{} E_{heat}$, giving 
        \begin{equation*}
                0 = -\frac{1}{2} m{ v_{i}}^2+ mc\Delta{} T 
        \end{equation*}
        \begin{equation*}
                \frac{1}{2}{ v_{i}}^2        =  c\Delta{} T\eqquad.
        \end{equation*}
        Note how the mass cancels out. This is a big advantage of solving problems
        algebraically first, and waiting until the end to plug in numbers. With a purely
        numerical approach, we wouldn't even have known what value of
        $m$ to pick, or if we'd guessed a value like 1 kg, we wouldn't have known
        whether our answer depended on that guess.

        Solving for $\Delta T$, and writing $v$ instead of $v_i$
        for simplicity, we find
        \begin{align*}
                \Delta{} T & = \frac{ v^2}{2 c} \\
                                &\approx 40^{\circ}\zu{C}\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        The passengers would be boiled alive if not for the refrigeration. The
        first
        stage of cooling happens via heat exchangers in the engine struts, but
        a second stage, using a refrigerator under the floor of the cabin, is also
        necessary. Running this refrigerator uses up energy, cutting into the
        fuel efficiency of the airplane, which is why typically only 50\% of the
        cabin's air is replaced in each pumping cycle of 2-3 minutes. Although the
        airlines prefer to
        emphasize that this is a much faster recirculation rate than in the ventilation
        systems of most buildings, people are packed more tightly in an
        airplane.

Power, $P$, is defined as the rate of change of energy, $\der{}E/\der{}t$.\index{power}
Power thus has units of joules per second, which are usually abbreviated
as watts, 1 W=1 J/s. Since energy is conserved, we would have
$\der{}E/\der{}t=0$ if $E$ was the total energy of a closed system,
and that's not very interesting. What's usually more interesting to discuss is either
the power flowing in or out of an open system, or the rate at which energy is
being transformed from one form into another. The following is an example
of energy flowing into an open system.

A typical person consumes
2000 Calories of food in a day, and converts nearly all of that
directly to body heat. Compare the person's heat production to the
rate of energy consumption of a 100-watt lightbulb.

\eganswer
Strictly speaking, we can't really
compute the derivative $\der{} E/\der{} t$, since we don't know how the
person's metabolism ebbs and flows over the course of a day. What we can
really compute is $\Delta E/\Delta t$, which is the power averaged over
a one-day period.

Converting to joules, we find $\Delta E=8\times10^6$ J 
for the amount of energy transformed into heat within our bodies in one day.
Converting the time interval likewise into SI units,
$\Delta t=9\times10^4$ s. Dividing, we find that our power
 is 90 J/s = 90 W, about the same as a lightbulb.

<% begin_sec("Gravitational energy") %>

Gravitational energy, to which I've already alluded, is different from heat and
kinetic energy in an important way. Heat and kinetic energy are properties of
a single object, whereas gravitational energy describes an interaction between
two objects. When the skater in figures \figref{skaterphoto} and \figref{skaterline}
is at the top, his distance from the bulk of the planet earth is greater. Since we
observe his kinetic energy decreasing on the way up, there must be some
other form of energy that is increasing. We invent a new form of energy, called
gravitational energy, and written $U$ or $U_g$, which depends on the
distance between his body and
the planet. Where is this energy? It's not in the skater's body, and it's not inside
the earth, either, since it takes two to tango. If either object didn't exist, there
wouldn't be any interaction or any way to measure a distance,
so it wouldn't make sense to talk about a distance-dependent energy.
Just as marriage is a relationship between two people, gravitational energy
is a relationship between two objects.

There is no precise way to define the distance between the skater and the
earth, since both are objects that have finite size.
As discussed in more detail in
section \ref{gravphenomenasection}, gravity is one of the fundamental forces
of nature, a universal attraction between any two particles that have mass.
Each atom in the skater's
body is at a definite distance from each atom in the earth, but each of these
distances is different. An atom in his foot is only a few centimeters from some of
the atoms in the plaster side of the pool, but most of the earth's atoms are
thousands of kilometers away from him. In theory, we might have to add up
the contribution to the gravitational energy for every interaction between an
atom in the skater's body and an atom in the earth.

For our present purposes, however, there is a far simpler and more practical
way to solve problems. In any region of the earth's surface, there is a direction
called ``down,'' which we can establish by dropping a rock or hanging a plumb
bob. In figure \figref{skaterline}, the skater is moving up and down in one dimension,
and if we did measurements of his kinetic energy, like the made-up data in the
figure, we could infer his gravitational energy. As long as we stay within a relatively
small range of heights, we find that an object's gravitational energy increases at
a steady rate with height. In other words, the strength of gravity doesn't change
much if you only move up or down a few meters. We also find that the gravitational
energy is proportional to the mass of the object we're testing.
Writing $y$ for the height, and $g$ for the
overall constant of proportionality, we have
%\begin{multline*}%
%        \shoveright{U_g=mgy\eqquad. \qquad \text{[gravitational energy;  $x$=height;}}\\ 
%                \text{only accurate within a small range of heights]}%
%\end{multline}%
\begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{cr}
                U_g=mgy\eqquad. & \text{[gravitational energy;  $y$=height; only ac-} \\
                        & \text{curate within a small range of heights]}
        \end{array}
\end{equation*}
The number $g$, with units of joules per kilogram per meter, is called the
\emph{gravitational field}\index{gravitational field}. It tells us the strength of gravity
in a certain region of space. Near the surface of our planet, it has a value of
about 9.8 $\gravunit$, which is conveniently close to 10 $\gravunit$ for rough
calculations.

\begin{eg}{Velocity at the bottom of a drop}
\egquestion
If the skater in figure \figref{skaterphoto} drops 3 meters from rest, what is
his velocity at the bottom of the pool?

\eganswer
        Starting from conservation of energy, we have
        \begin{align*}
                0        &=        \Delta E  \\
                                &=        \Delta K +\Delta U   \\
                                &=         K_f - K_i + U_f - U_i  \\
                                &=        \frac{1}{2} m { v_f }^2
                                                + mgy_f - mgy_i  
                                                                                & \text{(because $K_i$=0)} \\
                                &=        \frac{1}{2} m { v_f }^2
                                                + mg \Delta y\eqquad, 
                                                                                & \text{($\Delta y<$0)} 
                \intertext{so}
                 v         &=        \sqrt{-2 g \Delta y} \\
                                &=        \sqrt{-\zu{(2)(10\ J/kg}\unitdot{}\zu{m)(}-\zu{3 m)}} \\
                                &=        \zu{8 m/s} & \text{(rounded to one sig. fig.)}
        \end{align*}
\end{eg}
There are a couple of important things to note about this example. First, we were able
to massage the equation so that it only involved $\Delta{}y$, rather than $y$ itself.
In other words, we don't need to worry about where $y=0$ is; any coordinate system
will work, as long as the positive $y$ axis points up, not down. This is no accident.
Gravitational energy can always be changed by adding a constant onto it, 
with no effect on the final result, as long as you're consistent within a given problem.

The other interesting thing is that the mass canceled out: even if the skater gained weight
or strapped lead weights to himself, his velocity at the bottom would still be 8 m/s.
This isn't an accident either.
This is the same conclusion we reached in section \ref{gravinersection}, based on the
equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass. The kinetic energy depends on the
inertial mass, while gravitational energy is related to gravitational mass, but since
these two masses are equal, we were able to use a single symbol, $m$, for them, and
cancel them out.

We can see from the equation $v=\sqrt{-2g\Delta{}y}$ that a falling object's velocity
isn't constant. It increases as the object drops farther and farther. What about its
acceleration? If we assume that air friction is negligible, the arguments in
section \ref{gravinersection} show that
the acceleration can't depend on the object's mass, so there isn't much else
the acceleration \emph{can} depend on besides $g$. In fact, the acceleration
of a falling object equals $-g$ (in a coordinate system where the positive $y$
axis points up), as we can easily show using the chain rule:\label{gaccelproof}
\begin{align*}
        \left(\frac{\der{}v}{\der{}t}\right)%
                &=        \left(\frac{\der{}v}{\der{}K}\right)% 
                        \left(\frac{\der{}K}{\der{}U}\right)% 
                        \left(\frac{\der{}U}{\der{}y}\right)% 
                        \left(\frac{\der{}y}{\der{}t}\right) \\
                &= \left(\frac{1}{mv}\right)(-1)(mg)(v) \\
                &= -g\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where I've calculated $\der{}v/\der{}K$ as $1/(\der{}K/\der{}v)$, and $\der{}K/\der{}U=-1$
can be found by differentiating $K+U=\text{(constant)}$ to give $\der{}K+\der{}U=0$.\footnote{There
is a mathematical loophole in this argument that would allow the object to hover for a while with zero velocity and zero acceleration.
This point is discussed on page \pageref{hovering}.\label{hoveringrefback}}

We can also check that the units of $g$, $\gravunit$, are equivalent to the units
of acceleration,
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\junit}{\kgunit\unitdot\munit} = 
                        \frac{\kgunit\unitdot\munit^2/\sunit^2}
                        {\kgunit\unitdot\munit} \\
                = \frac{\munit}{\sunit^2}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
and therefore the strength of the gravitational field near the earth's surface
 can just as well be stated as $10\ \munit/\sunit^2$.

\begin{eg}{Speed after a given time}
\egquestion
An object falls from rest.
How fast is it moving after two seconds? Assume that the
amount of energy converted to heat by air friction is negligible.

\eganswer
Under the stated assumption, we have $a=- g$, which can be
integrated to give $v=- gt+\text{constant}$. If we let $t=0$
be the beginning of the fall, then the constant of integration is zero,
so at $t=\zu{2\ s}$ we have
$v=- gt=-\zu{(10 m/s}^2\zu{)}\times\zu{(2 s)}=\zu{20 m/s}$.

\begin{eg}{The Vomit Comet}\label{eg:vomitcomet}
\egquestion
The U.S. Air Force has an airplane, affectionately known as the Vomit Comet,
in which astronaut trainees can experience simulated weightlessness.
Oversimplifying a little, imagine that the plane climbs up high, and then drops straight down like a rock.
(It actually flies along a parabola.)
Since the people are falling
with the same acceleration as the plane, the sensation is just like what you'd
experience if you went out of the earth's gravitational field. If the plane can
start from 10 km up, what is the maximum amount of time for which the dive
can last?

\eganswer
Based on data about acceleration and distance, we want to find time.
Acceleration is the second derivative of distance, so if we integrate the
acceleration twice with respect to time, we can find how position relates
to time. For convenience, let's pick a coordinate system in which the positive
$y$ axis is down, so $a$=$g$ instead of $- g$.
\begin{align*}
         a        &=         g \\
         v        &=         gt + \zu{constant}        & \text{(integrating)} \\
                        &=         gt        & \text{(starts from rest)} \\
         y        &=        \frac{1}{2} gt^2 +\zu{constant}
                                        & \text{(integrating again)}
\end{align*}
Choosing our coordinate system to have $y=0$ at $t=0$,
                we can make the second constant of integration equal zero as well, so
\begin{align*}
         t                &=        \sqrt{\frac{2 y}{ g}} \\
                        &=        \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot\zu{10000 m}}{\zu{10 m/s}^2}} \\
                        &=        \sqrt{\zu{2000\ s}^2} \\
                        &=        \zu{40\ s} & \text{(to one sig. fig.)}
\end{align*}
Note that if we hadn't converted the altitude to units of meters, we would have
gotten the wrong answer, but we would have been alerted to the problem
because the units inside the square root wouldn't have come out to be
$\zu{s}^2$. In general, it's a good idea to convert all your data into
SI (meter-kilogram-second) units before you do anything with them.

\begin{eg}{High road, low road}\label{eg:highlow}
\egquestion
In figure \figref{highlow}, what can you say based on conservation of energy
about the speeds of the balls when the reach point B? What does
conservation of energy tell you about which ball will get there first?
Assume friction doesn't convert any mechanical energy to heat or sound energy.

\eganswer
Since friction is assumed to be negligible, there are only two forms of energy
involved: kinetic and gravitational. Since both balls start from rest, and both
lose the same amount of gravitational energy, they must have the same
kinetic energy at the end, and therefore they're rolling at the same speed when
they reach B. (A subtle point is that the balls have kinetic energy both because they're
moving through space and because they're spinning as they roll. These two types of
energy must be in fixed proportion to one another, so this has no effect on the conclusion.)

Conservation of energy does not, however, tell us anything obvious about which ball
gets there first. This is a general problem with applying conservation laws:
conservation laws don't refer directly to time, since they are statements
that something stays the same at all moments in time. We expect on
intuitive grounds that the ball that goes by the lower ramp gets to B first, since
it builds up speed early on.

\begin{eg}{Buoyancy}\label{eg:buoyancycube}
\index{buoyancy}\index{Archimedes' principle}
\egquestion
A cubical box with mass $m$ and volume $V= b^3$ is submerged in a fluid
of density $\rho$. How much energy is required to raise it through a height $\Delta y$?

\eganswer
As the box moves up, it invades a volume $V'= b^2\Delta y$ 
previously occupied
by some of the fluid, and fluid flows into an equal volume that it has vacated on the bottom.
Lowering this amount of fluid by a height $b$ reduces the fluid's gravitational energy
by $\rho V' gb=\rho g b^3\Delta y$, so the net change in energy is
\begin{align*}
        \Delta  E        &=  mg\Delta y-\rho g b^3\Delta y \\
                                &= ( m-\rho V) g\Delta y\eqquad.
\end{align*}
In other words, it's as if the mass of the box had been reduced by an amount equal
to the fluid that otherwise would have occupied that volume. This is known as Archimedes'
principle, and it is true even if the box is not a cube, although we'll defer the more general
proof until page \pageref{eg:buoyancy} in chapter \ref{ch:3}. If the box is less dense than
the fluid, then it will float.

\egquestion
If the father and son on the seesaw in figure \figref{seesaw} start from rest,
what will happen?

        \eganswer
        Note that although the father is twice as massive, he is at half the distance
        from the fulcrum. If the seesaw was going to start rotating, it would have to be
        losing gravitational energy in order to gain some kinetic energy. However,
        there is no way for it to gain or lose gravitational energy by rotating in either
        direction. The change in gravitational energy would be
        \begin{align*}
                \Delta U                &=        \Delta U_{1} + \Delta U_{2} \\
                        &=         g( m_1\Delta y_{1} + m_{2}\Delta y_2 )
\eqquad,
        \end{align*}
        but $\Delta y_1$ and $\Delta y_2$ have opposite signs and
        are in the proportion of two to one,
        since the son moves along a circular arc that covers the same angle as the father's
        but has half the radius. Therefore $\Delta U=0$, and there is no way for the
        seesaw to trade gravitational energy for kinetic. 
        \end{eg}

The seesaw example demonstrates the principle of the lever,
which is one of the basic mechanical building blocks known as simple machines.
As discussed in more detail in chapters \ref{ch:3} and \ref{ch:4}, the principle applies even when
the interactions involved aren't gravitational.

Note that although a lever makes it easier to lift a heavy weight, it also decreases
the distance traveled by the load. By reversing the lever, we can make the load travel
a greater distance, at the expense of increasing the amount of force required. 
The human muscular-skeletal system uses reversed levers of this kind, which
allows us to move more rapidly, and also makes our bodies more compact, at
the expense of brute strength. A piano uses reversed levers so that a small amount
of motion of the key produces a longer swing of the hammer. Another interesting example
is the hydraulic jack shown in figure \figref{hydraulic}. The analysis in terms of
gravitational energy is exactly the same as for the seesaw, except that the
relationship between $\Delta{}y_1$ and $\Delta{}y_2$ is now determined not
by geometry but by conservation of mass: since water is highly incompressible,
conservation of mass is approximately the same as a requirement of constant
volume, which can only be satisfied if the distance traveled by each piston is
in inverse proportion to its cross-sectional area.

The seesaw in figure  \figref{seesaw} is in equilibrium, meaning that if it starts out
being at rest, it will stay put.\index{equilibrium}
This is known as a neutral equilibrium\index{equilibrium!neutral}\index{neutral equilibrium}, since the seesaw
has no preferred position to which it will return if we disturb it. If we move it to a different
position and release it, it will stay at rest there as well. If we put it in motion, it will simply
continue in motion until one person's feet hit the ground.

Most objects around you are
in stable equilibria\index{equilibrium!stable}\index{stability}, like the black block in figure
\figref{equilibrium}/3. Even if the block is moved or set in motion, it will oscillate
about the equilibrium position. The pictures are like graphs of $y$ versus
$x$, but since the gravitational energy $U=mgy$ is proportional to $y$, we can just
as well think of them as graphs of  $U$ versus $x$. The block's stable equilibrium
position is where the function $U(x)$ has a local minimum.
The book you're reading right now is in equilibrium, but gravitational energy isn't the
only form of energy involved. To move it upward, we'd have to supply gravitational
energy, but downward motion would require a different kind of energy, in order to
compress the table more. (As we'll see in section \ref{atomicphenomenasection},
this is electrical energy due to interactions between atoms within the table.)

A differentiable function's local extrema occur where its derivative is zero.
A position where $\der{}U/\der{}x$ is zero can be a stable
(3), neutral (2), or unstable equilibrium, (4). An unstable\index{unstable equilibrium}\index{equilibrium!unstable}
equilibrium is like a pencil balanced on its tip. Although it could theoretically
remain balanced there forever, in reality it will topple due to any tiny perturbation,
such as an air current or a vibration from a passing truck. This is a technical,
mathematical definition of instability, which is more restrictive than the way the
word is used in ordinary speech. Most people would describe a
domino standing upright as being unstable, but in technical usage it would be
considered stable, because a certain finite amount of energy is required to tip
it over, and perturbations smaller than that would only cause it to oscillate around
its equilibrium position.

The domino is also an interesting example because
it has two local minima, one in which it is upright, and another in which it is
lying flat. A local minimum that is not the global minimum, as in figure \figref{equilibrium}/5, is
referred to as a metastable equilibrium\index{equilibrium!metastable}.

one car goes up, the other comes down. They pass each other in the middle. Since one car's gravitational energy is increasing while the

The U-shaped tube in figure \figref{utube} has cross-sectional area
 $A$, and the density of the water inside

figure, and show that there is an equilibrium at $y$=0.

\eganswer
The question is a little ambiguous, since gravitational energy is only well defined
up to an additive constant. To fix this constant, let's define $U$ to be zero when $y$=0.
The difference between $U( y)$ and $U(0)$ is the energy that would
be required to lift a water column of height $y$ out of the right side, and place it
above the dashed line, on the left side, raising it through a height $y$.
This water column has height $y$ and
cross-sectional area $A$, so its volume is $Ay$, its mass is $\rho Ay$, and
the energy required is $mgy$=$(\rho Ay) gy$=$\rho gAy^2$.
We then have $U( y)= U(0)+\rho gAy^2=\rho gAy^2$.

To find equilibria, we look for places where the derivative

The second derivative test shows that this is a local minimum (not a maximum or
a point of inflection), so this is a stable equilibrium.

Kinetic energy doesn't depend on the direction of motion. Sometimes this is
helpful, as in the high road-low road example (p. \pageref{eg:highlow},
example \ref{eg:highlow}), where we were able to predict that the balls
would have the same final speeds, even though they followed different
paths and were moving in different directions at the end. In general, however,
the two conservation laws we've encountered so far aren't enough to
predict an object's path through space, for which we need conservation of
momentum (chapter \ref{ch:3}), and the mathematical technique of vectors. Before
we develop those ideas in their full generality, however, it will be helpful
to do a couple of simple examples, including one that we'll get a lot of mileage
out of in section \ref{gravphenomenasection}.

Suppose we observe an air hockey puck gliding frictionlessly to the right
at a velocity $v$, and we want to predict its future motion. Since there is
no friction, no kinetic energy is converted to heat. The only form of energy
involved is kinetic energy, so conservation of energy, $\Delta{}E=0$, becomes
simply $\Delta{}K=0$. There's no particular reason for the puck to do anything
but continue moving to the right at constant speed, but it would be equally
consistent with conservation of energy if it spontaneously decided to reverse
its direction of motion, changing its velocity to $-v$. Either way, we'd have  $\Delta{}K=0$.         There is, however,
a way to tell which motion is physical and which is unphysical. Suppose we
consider the whole thing again in the frame of reference that is initially moving
right along with the puck. In this frame, the puck starts out with $K=0$. What we
originally described as a reversal of its velocity from $v$ to $-v$ is, in this new
frame of reference, a change from zero velocity to $-2v$, which would violate
conservation of energy. In other words, the physically possible motion conserves
energy in all frames of reference, but the unphysical motion only conserves
energy in one special frame of reference.

        For our second example, we consider a car driving off the edge of a cliff (\figref{cliff}).
        For simplicity, we assume that air friction is negligible, so only kinetic and gravitational
        energy are involved.
        Does the car follow trajectory 1, familiar from Road Runner cartoons, trajectory 2, a parabola,
        or 3, a diagonal line? All three could be consistent with conservation of energy, in the
        ground's frame of reference. For instance, the car would have constant gravitational
        energy along the initial horizontal segment of trajectory 1, so during that time it would
        have to maintain constant kinetic energy as well. Only a parabola, however, is
        consistent with conservation of energy combined with Galilean relativity.  Consider the frame
        of reference that is moving horizontally at the same speed as that with which the car
        went over the edge. In this frame of reference, the cliff slides out from under the
        initially motionless car. The car can't just hover for a while, so trajectory 1 is out.
        Repeating the same math as in example \ref{eg:vomitcomet}
        on p. \pageref{eg:vomitcomet}, we have
        \begin{equation*}
                x^*=0\ , \qquad y^*=\frac{1}{2}gt^2
        \end{equation*}
        in this
        frame of reference, where the stars indicate coordinates measured in the moving
        frame of reference. These coordinates are related to the ground-fixed coordinates
        $(x,y)$ by the equations
        \begin{equation*}
                x=x^*+vt \qquad and \qquad y=y^*\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        where $v$ is the velocity of one
        frame with respect to the other. We therefore have
        \begin{equation*}
                x=vt \ , \qquad y=\frac{1}{2}gt^2\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        in our
        original frame of reference. Eliminating $t$, we can see that this has the
        form of a parabola:
        \begin{equation*}
                y=\frac{g}{2v^2}x^2\eqquad.

\label{numsection}

Engineering majors are a majority of the students in the kind of physics
course for which this book is designed, so most likely you fall into that category.
Although you surely recognize that physics is an important
part of your training, if you've had any exposure to how engineers really
work, you're probably skeptical about the flavor of problem-solving
taught in most science courses. You
realize that not very many practical engineering calculations fall
into the narrow range of problems for which an exact solution can be calculated
with a piece of paper and a sharp pencil. Real-life problems are usually
complicated, and typically they need to be solved by number-crunching on a computer,
although we can often gain insight by working simple approximations that
have algebraic solutions. Not only is numerical problem-solving more useful
in real life, it's also educational; as a beginning physics student, I really only felt like
I understood projectile motion after I had worked it both ways, using algebra
and then a computer program. (This was back in the days when 64 kilobytes
of memory was considered a lot.)

In this section, we'll start by seeing how to apply numerical techniques
to some simple problems for which we know the answer in ``closed form,'' i.e.,
a single algebraic expression without any calculus or infinite sums.
After that, we'll solve a problem that would have made you world-famous
if you could have done it in the seventeenth century using
paper and a quill pen!
Before you continue, you should read Appendix \ref{pythonappendix} on page
\pageref{pythonappendix} that introduces you to the Python programming
language.

        First let's solve the trivial problem of finding how much time it takes         
        an object moving at speed \verb-v- to travel a straight-line distance \verb-dist-. This
        closed-form answer is, of course, \verb-dist/v-, but the point is to introduce
        the techniques we can use to solve other problems of this type. The basic
        idea is to divide the distance up into \verb-n- equal parts, and add up the
        times required to traverse all the parts. The following Python function
        does the job. Note that you shouldn't type in the line numbers on the left,
        and you don't need to type in the comments, either. I've omitted the prompts
        \verb->>>- and \verb-...- in order to save space.
\begin{listing}{1}<%code_listing('constant_speed.py',%q{
import math
def time1(dist,v,n):
  x=0                        # Initialize the position.
  dx = dist/n                # Divide dist into n equal parts.
  t=0                        # Initialize the time.
  for i in range(n):
    x = x+dx                # Change x.
    dt=dx/v                #  time=distance/speed
    t=t+dt                # Keep track of elapsed time.
  return t
})%>
\end{listing}
        How long does it take to move
        1 meter at a constant speed of 1 m/s? If we do this,
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(time1(1.0,1.0,10))        # dist, v, n
0.99999999999999989
\end{verbatim}
        \noindent{}Python produces the expected answer by dividing the distance
        into ten equal 0.1-meter segments, and adding up the ten 0.1-second
        times required to traverse each one. Since the object moves at 
        constant speed, it doesn't even matter whether we set \verb-n- to
        10, 1, or a million:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(time1(1.0,1.0,1))        # dist, v, n
1.0
\end{verbatim}

        Now let's do an example where the answer isn't obvious to people
        who don't know calculus: how long does it take an object to fall
        through a height \verb-h-, starting from rest? We know from
        example \ref{eg:vomitcomet} on page \pageref{eg:vomitcomet} that
        the exact answer, found using calculus, is $\sqrt{2h/g}$. Let's see
        if we can reproduce that answer numerically. The main
        difference between this program and the previous one is that now
        the velocity isn't constant, so we need to update it as we go along.
        Conservation of energy gives $mgh=(1/2)mv^2+mgy$ for the
        velocity $v$ at height $y$, so $v=-\sqrt{2g(h-y)}$. (We choose the negative
        root because the object is moving down, and our coordinate system
        has the positive $y$ axis pointing up.)\label{program-time2}
\begin{listing}{1}<%code_listing('falling.py',%q{
import math
def time2(h,n):
  g=9.8                     # gravitational field
  y=h                       # Initialize the height.
  v=0                       # Initialize the velocity.
  dy = -h/n                 # Divide h into n equal parts.
  t=0                       # Initialize the time.
  for i in range(n):
    y = y+dy                # Change y. (Note dy<0.)
    v = -math.sqrt(2*g*(h-y))        # from cons. of energy
    dt=dy/v                 #  dy and v are <0, so dt is >0
    t=t+dt                  # Keep track of elapsed time.
  return t
})%>
\end{listing}
        For \verb-h-=1.0 m, the closed-form result is
        $\sqrt{2\cdot1.0\ \munit/9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2}=0.45\ \sunit$.
        With the drop split up into only 10 equal height intervals, the numerical
        technique provides a pretty lousy approximation:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(time2(1.0,10))        # h, n
0.35864270709233342
\end{verbatim}
        But by increasing \verb-n- to ten thousand, we get an answer that's as close
        as we need, given the limited accuracy of the raw data:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(time2(1.0,10000))        # h, n
0.44846664060793945
\end{verbatim}

A subtle point is that we changed \verb-y- in line 9, and \emph{then} on line 10
we calculated \verb-v-, which depends on \verb-y-.
Since \verb-y- is only changing by a ten-thousandth
of a meter with each step, you might think this wouldn't make much of
a difference, and you'd be almost right, except for one small problem:
if we swapped lines 9 and 10, then the very first time through the loop,
we'd have \verb-v-=0, which would produce a division-by-zero error
when we calculated \verb-dt-! Actually what would make the most sense
would be to calculate the velocity at height \verb-y- and 
the velocity at height \verb-y+dy- (recalling that \verb-dy- is negative),
average them together, and use that value of \verb-y- to calculate
 the best estimate of the velocity
between those two points. Since the acceleration is constant in the present
example, this modification results in a program that gives an exact
result even for \verb-n-=1:\label{time3listing}

Now we're ready to attack a problem that challenged the best
minds of Europe
back in the days when there were no computers. In 1696, the mathematician
Johann Bernoulli\index{Bernoulli, Johann}
posed the following famous question. Starting from rest,
an object slides frictionlessly
over a curve joining the point $(a,b)$ to the point $(0,0)$. Of all the possible shapes
that such a curve could have, which one gets the object to its destination in
the least possible time, and how much time does it take? The optimal
curve is called the \emph{brachistochrone}\index{brachistochrone}, from the
Greek ``short time.'' The solution to the brachistochrone problem evaded
Bernoulli himself, as well as Leibniz,\index{Leibniz}
 who had been one of the inventors of
calculus. The English physicist Isaac Newton,\index{Newton, Isaac}
however,  stayed up late one night after a day's
work running the royal mint, and, according to legend,
produced an algebraic solution at four
in the morning. He then published it anonymously, but Bernoulli is said to have
remarked that when he read it, he knew instantly from the style that it was Newton ---
he could ``tell the lion from the mark of his claw.''

        %        gives 0.58467623884591269 s with n=10e5
        Rather than attempting an exact algebraic solution, as Newton did,
        we'll produce a numerical
        result for the shape of the curve and the minimum time, in the special
        case of $a$=1.0 m and $b$=1.0 m. Intuitively, we want to start with a fairly
        steep drop, since any speed we can build up at the start will help us throughout
        the rest of the motion. On the other hand, it's possible to go too far with this idea:
        if we drop straight down for the whole vertical distance, and then do a right-angle turn to
        cover the horizontal distance, the resulting time of 0.68 s is quite a bit longer than
        the optimal result, the reason being that the path is unnecessarily long.
        There are infinitely many possible curves for which we could calculate the
        time, but let's look at third-order polynomials,
        \begin{equation*}
                y = c_1x+c_2x^2+c_3x^3\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        where we require $c_3=(b-c_1a-c_2a^2)/a^3$ in order to make the curve
        pass through the point $(a,b)$. The Python program, below, is not much
        different from what we've done before. The function only asks for $c_1$
        and $c_2$, and calculates $c_3$ internally at line 4. Since the motion is
        two-dimensional, we have to calculate the distance between one point and
        the next using the Pythagorean theorem, at line 16.
\begin{listing}{1}<%code_listing('brachistochrone.py',%q{
import math
def timeb(a,b,c1,c2,n):
  g=9.8
  c3 = (b-c1*a-c2*a**2)/(a**3)

  y=b
  dx = -a/n
  t=0
  for i in range(n):
    y_old = y
    x = x+dx
    y = c1*x+c2*x**2+c3*x**3
    dy = y-y_old
    v_old = math.sqrt(2*g*(b-y_old))
    v = math.sqrt(2*g*(b-y))
    v_avg = (v_old+v)/2.
    ds = math.sqrt(dx**2+dy**2)        # Pythagorean thm.
    dt=ds/v_avg
    t=t+dt
  return t
})%>
\end{listing}

        As a first guess, we could try a straight diagonal line, $y=x$, which
        corresponds to setting $c_1=1$, and all the other coefficients to zero.
        The result is a fairly long time:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> a=1.
>>> b=1.
>>> n=10000
>>> c1=1.
>>> c2=0.
>>> print(timeb(a,b,c1,c2,n))
0.63887656499994161
\end{verbatim}
        What we really need is a curve that's very steep on the right, and flatter on the left,
        so it would actually make more sense to try $y=x^3$:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> c1=0.
>>> c2=0.
>>> print(timeb(a,b,c1,c2,n))
0.59458339947087069
\end{verbatim}
        This is a significant improvement, and turns out to be only a hundredth of
        a second off of the shortest possible time!\label{brachrefback}
        It's possible, although not very educational or entertaining, to find better
        approximations to the brachistochrone curve by fiddling around with
        the coefficients of the polynomial by hand. The real point of this
        discussion was to give an example of a nontrivial problem that can be
        attacked successfully with numerical techniques. I found the first approximation
        shown in figure \figref{brachgraph},
\begin{equation*}
                y = (0.62)x+(-0.93)x^2+(1.31)x^3
\end{equation*}
        by using the program listed in appendix \ref{miscappendix}
        on page \pageref{brachsearchcode} to search
        automatically for the optimal curve. The seventh-order approximation
        shown in the figure came from a straightforward extension of the same program.

This section is about Newton's theory of gravity, which he used
to explain the motion of the planets as they orbited the sun.
Newton tosses off a general treatment of motion in the first 20 pages
of his \textbf{Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy},
 and then spends the next 130 discussing the
motion of the planets. Clearly he saw this as the crucial scientific
focus of his work. Why? Because in it he showed that the same laws of
nature applied to the heavens as to the earth, and that the
gravitational interaction that made an apple fall was the same as the as the one
that kept the earth's motion from carrying it away from the sun.

        wouldn't have been able to figure out \emph{why} the planets move
        the way they do if it hadn't been for the astronomer Tycho
        Brahe (1546-1601) and his protege Johannes Kepler
        (1571-1630), who together came up with the first simple and
        accurate description of \emph{how} the planets actually do move.
        The difficulty of their task is suggested by the figure
        below, which shows how the relatively simple orbital motions
        of the earth and Mars combine so that as seen from earth
        Mars appears to be staggering in loops like a drunken

Brahe, the last of the great
naked-eye astronomers, collected extensive data on the
motions of the planets over a period of many years, taking
the giant step from the previous observations' accuracy of
about 10 minutes of arc (10/60 of a degree) to an
unprecedented 1 minute. The quality of his work is all the
more remarkable considering that his observatory consisted
of four giant brass protractors mounted upright in his
castle in Denmark. Four different observers would
simultaneously measure the position of a planet in order to
check for mistakes and reduce random errors.

With
Brahe's death, it fell to his former assistant Kepler to try
to make some sense out of the volumes of data.
After 900 pages of calculations and
many false starts and dead-end ideas, Kepler finally
synthesized the data into the following three laws:

\myindented{4mm}{
\noindent\textbf{Kepler's elliptical orbit law:} The planets orbit the sun in
elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.\\
\textbf{Kepler's equal-area law:} The line connecting a planet to the
sun sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of
time.\\
\textbf{Kepler's law of periods:} The time required
for a planet to orbit the sun, called its period, $T$, is
proportional to the long axis of the ellipse raised to the
3/2 power. The constant of proportionality is the same for
all the planets.}

Although the planets' orbits are
ellipses rather than circles, most are very close to being
circular. The earth's orbit, for instance, is only
flattened by 1.7\% relative to a circle. In the special case
of a planet in a circular orbit, the two foci (plural of
``focus'') coincide at the center of the circle, and Kepler's
elliptical orbit law thus says that the circle is centered
on the sun. The equal-area law implies that a planet in a
circular orbit moves around the sun with constant speed. 
For a circular orbit, the law of periods then amounts to a
statement that the time for one orbit is proportional to
$r^{3/2}$, where $r$ is the radius. If all the planets were moving
in their orbits at the same speed, then the time for one
orbit would simply depend on the circumference of the
circle, so it would only be proportional to $r$ to the first
power. The more drastic dependence on $r^{3/2}$ means that the
outer planets must be moving more slowly than the inner
planets.

Our main focus in this section will be to use the law of
periods to deduce the general equation for
gravitational energy. The equal-area law turns out to be
a statement on conservation of angular momentum, which is
discussed in chapter \ref{ch:4}. We'll demonstrate the elliptical orbit
law numerically in chapter \ref{ch:3}, and analytically in chapter \ref{ch:4}.

        Kepler's laws say that planets move along elliptical paths (with circles as a special
        case), which would seem to contradict the proof on page \pageref{paraboladerivation}
        that objects moving under the influence of gravity have parabolic trajectories.
        Kepler was right. The parabolic path was really only an approximation, based
        on the assumption that the gravitational field is constant, and that vertical lines
        are all parallel. In figure \figref{cannon}, trajectory 1 is an ellipse, but
        it gets chopped off when the cannonball hits the earth, and the small piece
        of it that is above ground is nearly indistinguishable from a parabola.
        Our goal is to connect the previous calculation of parabolic trajectories,
        $y=(g/2v^2)x^2$, with Kepler's data for planets orbiting the sun in nearly
        circular orbits. Let's start by thinking in terms of an orbit that circles the earth,
        like orbit 2 in figure \figref{cannon}. It's more natural now to choose
        a coordinate system with its origin at the center of the earth, so the parabolic
        approximation becomes $y=r-(g/2v^2)x^2$, where $r$ is the distance from the
        center of the earth. For small values of $x$, i.e., when the cannonball hasn't
        traveled very far from the muzzle of the gun, the parabola is still a good
        approximation to the actual circular orbit, defined by the Pythagorean theorem,
        $r^2=x^2+y^2$, or $y=r\sqrt{1-x^2/r^2}$. For small values of $x$, we can use
        the approximation $\sqrt{1+\epsilon}\approx1+\epsilon/2$ to find
        $y\approx{}r-(1/2r)x^2$. Setting this equal to the equation of the parabola,
        we have $g/2v^2=(1/2r)$, or
        \begin{equation*}
                v = \sqrt{gr} \qquad \text{[condition for a circular orbit]}\eqquad.
        \end{equation*}

\begin{eg}{Low-earth orbit}
        To get a feel for what this all means, let's calculate the velocity
        required for a satellite in a circular low-earth orbit. Real low-earth-orbit
        satellites are only a few hundred km up, so for purposes of rough
        estimation we can take $r$ to be
        the radius of the earth, and $g$ is not much less than its value on the
        earth's surface, 10 $\zu{m/s}^2$. Taking numerical data from
        Appendix \ref{dataappendix}, we have
        \begin{align*}
                 v        &= \sqrt{ gr} \\
                                &= \sqrt{(10\ \munit/\sunit^2)(6.4\times10^3\ \zu{km})} \\
                                &= \sqrt{(10\ \munit/\sunit^2)(6.4\times10^6\ \zu{m})} \\
                                &= \sqrt{ 6.4\times10^7\ \zu{m}^2/\zu{s}^2} \\
                                &= \zu{8000 m/s}
        \end{align*}
        (about twenty times the speed of sound).

        In one second, the satellite moves 8000 m horizontally. During this time, it
        drops the same distance any other object would: about 5 m.
        But a drop of 5 m over a horizontal distance of 8000 m is just enough to keep
        it at the same altitude above the earth's curved surface.
\end{eg}

<% begin_sec("The sun's gravitational field",nil,'sungrav') %>

We can now use the circular orbit condition $v = \sqrt{gr}$, combined with Kepler's
law of periods, $T\propto{}r^{3/2}$ for circular orbits, to determine how the sun's gravitational
field falls off with distance.\footnote{There
is a hidden assumption here, which is that the sun doesn't move.
Actually the sun wobbles a little because of the planets' gravitational interactions
with it, but the wobble is small due to the sun's large mass, so
it's a pretty good approximation to assume the sun is stationary. Chapter \ref{ch:3} provides
the tools to analyze this sort of thing completely correctly
 --- see p. \pageref{eg:earthmooncg}.}
From there, it will be just a hop, skip, and a jump to
get to a universal description of gravitational interactions.

The velocity of a planet in a circular orbit is proportional to $r/T$, so
\begin{align*}
        r/T        & \propto{}\sqrt{gr} \\
        r/r^{3/2}        & \propto{}\sqrt{gr} \\
        g        & \propto{}1/r^2
\end{align*}
If gravity behaves systematically, then we can expect the same to be true for the
gravitational field created by any object, not just the sun.

There is a subtle point here, which is that so far, $r$ has just meant the radius of a
circular orbit, but what we have come up with smells more like an equation that
tells us the strength of the gravitational field made by some object (the sun)
if we know how far we are from the object. In other words, we could reinterpret
$r$ as the distance from the sun.  

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Gravitational energy in general",3) %>

We now want to find an equation for the gravitational energy of any two masses
that attract each other from a distance $r$. We assume that $r$ is large enough compared
to the distance between the objects so that we don't really have to worry about
whether $r$ is measured from center to center or in some other way. This would
be a good approximation for describing the solar system, for example, since the sun
and planets are small compared to the distances between them --- that's why you
see Venus (the ``evening star'') with your bare eyes as a dot, not a disk.  

The equation we seek is going to give the gravitational energy, $U$, as a function
of $m_1$, $m_2$, and $r$. We already know from experience with gravity near the
earth's surface that $U$ is proportional to the mass of the object that interacts with
the earth gravitationally, so it makes sense to assume the relationship is symmetric:
$U$ is presumably proportional to the product $m_1m_2$. We can
no longer assume $\Delta{}U\propto{}\Delta{}r$, as in the earth's-surface equation
$\Delta{}U=mg\Delta{}y$, since we are trying to construct an equation that would be
valid for all values of $r$, and $g$ depends on $r$. We can, however,
consider an infinitesimally small change in distance $\der{}r$, for which
we'll have $\der{}U=m_2g_1\der{}r$, where $g_1$ is the gravitational field
created by $m_1$. (We could just as well have written this as $\der{}U=m_1g_2\der{}r$,
since we're not assuming either mass is ``special'' or ``active.'') Integrating this
equation, we have
\begin{align*}
        \int{\der{}U}        &= \int{m_2g_1\der{}r}\\
        U                        &= m_2\int{g_1\der{}r}\\
        U                        &\propto m_1m_2\int{\frac{1}{r^2}\der{}r}\\
        U                        &\propto -\frac{m_1m_2}{r}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where we're free to take the constant of integration to be equal to zero, since
gravitational energy is never a well-defined quantity in absolute terms. Writing $G$
for the constant of proportionality, we
have the following fundamental description of
gravitational interactions:
\begin{align*}
        U = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r} \qquad & \text{[gravitational energy of two masses}\\
                                                        & \text{separated by a distance $r$]}
\end{align*}
We'll refer to this as Newton's law of gravity, although in reality he stated it in
an entirely different form, which turns out to be mathematically equivalent to this one.

Let's interpret his result. First, don't get hung up on the fact that it's negative, since it's only
differences in gravitational energy that have physical significance. The graph in
figure \figref{ugraph} could be shifted up or down without having any physical effect.
The slope of this graph relates to the strength of the gravitational field. For instance,
suppose figure \figref{ugraph} is a graph of the gravitational energy of an asteroid
interacting with the sun. If the asteroid drops straight toward the sun, from A to B,
the decrease in gravitational energy is very small, so it won't speed up very much
during that motion. Points C and
D, however, are in a region where the graph's
slope is much greater.
As the asteroid moves from C to D, it loses a lot of gravitational
energy, and therefore speeds up considerably. This is due to the stronger gravitational field.

\begin{eg}{Determining G}\label{eg:cavendish}
The constant $G$ is not easy to determine, and Newton went to his grave without
knowing an accurate value for it. If we knew the mass of the earth, then we could
easily determine $G$ from experiments with terrestrial gravity, but the only way
to determine the mass of the earth accurately in units of kilograms
is by finding $G$ and reasoning the other way around! (If you estimate the average
density of the earth, you can make at least a rough estimate of $G$.)
Figures \figref{cavendish1} and \figref{cavendish2} show how $G$ was
first measured by Henry Cavendish in the nineteenth century.The
rotating arm is released from rest, and the kinetic energy of the two moving
balls is measured when they pass position C. Conservation of energy gives
\begin{equation*}
        -2\frac{ GMm}{ r_{BA}}  -2\frac{ GMm}{ r_{BD}} =
                -2\frac{ GMm}{ r_{CA}}  -2\frac{ GMm}{ r_{CD}}
                + 2 K\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $M$ is the mass of one of the large balls, $m$ is the mass of one of the small ones,
and the factors of two, which will cancel, occur because every energy is mirrored on the
opposite side of the apparatus.  
(As discussed on page \pageref{shelltheoremsubsection},
it turns out that we get the right result by measuring all
the distances from the center of one sphere to the center of the other.)
This can easily be solved for $G$. The best modern
value of $G$, from later versions of the same experiment, is
$ 6.67\times10^{-11}\ \zu{J}\cdot\zu{m}/\zu{kg}^2$.

\begin{eg}{Escape velocity}
\egquestion
The Pioneer 10 space probe was launched in 1972, and continued sending back signals for 30 years.
In the year 2001, not long before contact with the probe was lost, it was about
$ 1.2\times10^{13}\ \zu{m}$ from the sun, and was moving almost
directly away from the sun at a velocity of $ 1.21\times10^4\ \zu{m}$.
The mass of the sun is $ 1.99\times10^{30}\ \zu{kg}$. Will Pioneer 10
escape permanently, or will it fall back into the solar system?

\eganswer
We want to know whether there will be a point where the probe will turn around. If
so, then it will have zero kinetic energy at the turnaround point:
\begin{align*}
         K_{i}+ U_{i} &=  U_{f} \\
        \frac{1}{2} mv^2-\frac{ GMm}{ r_{i}} &=
                -\frac{ GMm}{ r_{f}} \\
        \frac{1}{2} v^2-\frac{ GM}{ r_{i}} &=
                -\frac{ GM}{ r_f}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where $M$ is the mass of the sun, $m$ is the (irrelevant) mass of the probe, and
$r_f$ is the distance from the sun of the hypothetical turnaround point.
Plugging in numbers on the left, we get a positive result. There can therefore
be no solution, since the right side is negative. There won't be any turnaround point,
and Pioneer 10 is never coming back.

The minimum velocity required for this to happen is called
\emph{escape velocity}.\index{escape velocity} For speeds above escape velocity,
the orbits are open-ended hyperbolas, rather than repeating elliptical orbits.
In figure \figref{pioneer}, Pioneer's hyperbolic trajectory
becomes
        almost indistinguishable from a line at large distances from the sun. The
        motion slows perceptibly in the first few years after 1974, but later the speed
        becomes nearly constant, as shown by the nearly constant spacing of the dots.

We got the energy equation $U = -Gm_1m_2/r$ by integrating $g\propto 1/r^2$
and then inserting a constant of proportionality
to make the proportionality into an equation. The opposite of an integral is a derivative,
so we can now go backwards and insert a 
 constant of proportionality in $g\propto 1/r^2$ that will be consistent with
 the energy equation:
\begin{align*}
        \der U         &= m_2 g_1 \der r \\
        g_1                &= \frac{1}{m_2} \,\frac{\der U}{\der r} \\
                        &= \frac{1}{m_2} \,\frac{\der}{\der r} \left(-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}\right)\\
                        &= -Gm_1 \,\frac{\der}{\der r} \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\\
                        &= \frac{Gm_1}{r^2}
\end{align*}
This kind of inverse-square law occurs all the time in nature. For instance,
if you go twice as far away from a lightbulb, you receive 1/4 as much light from
it, because as the light spreads out, it is like an expanding sphere, and
a sphere with twice the radius has four times the surface area. It's like
spreading the same amount of peanut butter on four pieces of bread instead of
one --- we have to spread it thinner.

\label{shelltheoremsubsection}\index{shell theorem}
        Newton's great insight was that gravity near the earth's surface was the same
        kind of interaction as the one that kept the planets from flying away from the sun.
        He told his niece that the idea came to him when he saw an apple fall from
        a tree, which made him wonder whether the earth might be affecting the apple
        and the moon in the same way. 
        Up until now, we've generally been dealing with gravitational interactions between
        objects that are small compared to the distances between them, but that assumption
        doesn't apply to the apple. A kilogram of dirt a few feet
        under his garden in England would interact much more strongly with the
        apple than a kilogram of molten rock deep under
        Australia, thousands of miles away. 
        Also, we know that the earth has some parts that
        are more dense, and some parts that are less dense. The
        solid crust, on which we live, is considerably less dense
        than the molten rock on which it floats. By all
        rights, the computation of the total gravitational energy of the apple
        should be a horrendous mess. Surprisingly, it turns out to be fairly simple         in the end. First, we note that although the earth doesn't have the same
        density throughout, it does have spherical symmetry: if we imagine
        dividing it up into thin concentric shells, the density of each shell
        is uniform.

Second, it turns out that a uniform spherical shell interacts with external
masses as if all its mass were concentrated at its center.

\mythmhdr{The shell theorem} The gravitational energy of a uniform spherical
shell of mass $M$ interacting with a pointlike mass $m$ outside it equals
$-GMm/s$, where $s$ is the center-to-center distance. If mass $m$ is inside
the shell, then the energy is constant, i.e., the shell's interior gravitational field is zero.

      A spherical shell of mass $M$ interacts with
              a pointlike mass $m$.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
%
        \mythmhdr{Proof} Let $b$ be the radius of the shell, $h$ its thickness, and $\rho$
        its density.
        Its volume is then $V$=(area)(thickness)=$4\pi{}b^2h$, and
        its mass is $M=\rho{}V=4\pi{}\rho{}b^2h$. The strategy is to divide the shell
        up into rings as shown in figure \figref{shellthm}, with each ring
        extending from $\theta$ to $\theta+\der{}\theta$. Since the ring is infinitesimally
        skinny, its entire mass lies at the same distance, $r$, from mass $m$.
        The width of such a ring is
        found by the definition of radian measure to be $w=b\der{}\theta$, and its mass
        is $\der{}M=(\rho)$(circumference)(thickness)(width)=
        $(\rho)(2\pi{}b \sin{} \theta)(h)(b\der{}\theta)$=$2\pi\rho b^2h\sin{}\theta\der{}\theta$.
        The gravitational energy of the ring interacting with mass $m$ is therefore
        \begin{align*}
                \der{}U        &= -\frac{Gm\der{}M}{r} \\
                                &= -2\pi{}G\rho{}b^2hm\frac{\sin{}\theta\der{}\theta}{r}\eqquad.
        \intertext{Integrating both sides, we find the total gravitational energy of the shell:}
                U                &= -2\pi{}G\rho{}b^2hm\int_0^\pi{\frac{\sin{}\theta\der{}\theta}{r}}
        \end{align*}
        The integral has a mixture of the variables $r$ and $\theta$, which are related
        by the law of cosines,
        \begin{equation*}
                r^2        =        b^2 + s^2 - 2bs\cos\theta\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        and to evaluate the integral, we need to get everything in terms of either $r$ and $\der{}r$
        or $\theta$ and $\der{}\theta$. The relationship
        between the differentials is found by differentiating the law of cosines,
        \begin{equation*}
                2r\der{}r        =        2bs\sin\theta\der\theta\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        and since $\sin\theta\der\theta$ occurs in the integral, the easiest path
        is to substitute for it, and get everything in terms of $r$ and $\der{}r$:
        \begin{align*}
                U                &= -\frac{2\pi{}G\rho{}bhm}{s}\int_{s-b}^{s+b}{\der{}r} \\
                                 &= -\frac{4\pi{}G\rho{}b^2hm}{s} \\
                                 &= -\frac{GMm}{s}
        \end{align*}
        This was all under the assumption that mass $m$ was on the outside of the shell.
        To complete the proof, we consider the case where it's inside. In this case,
        the only change is that the limits of integration are different:
        \begin{align*}
                U                &= -\frac{2\pi{}G\rho{}bhm}{s}\int_{b-s}^{b+s}{\der{}r} \\
                                 &= -4\pi{}G\rho{}bhm \\
                                 &= -\frac{GMm}{b}

        The two results are equal at the surface of the sphere, $s=b$, so the constant-energy
        part joins continuously onto the $1/s$ part, and the effect is to chop off the steepest
        part of the graph that we would have had if the whole mass $M$ had been concentrated
        at its center. Dropping a mass $m$ from A to B in figure \figref{ugraphshell} releases
        the same amount of energy as if mass $M$ had been concentrated at its center, but
        there is no release of gravitational energy at all when moving between two interior
        points like C and D. In other words, the internal gravitational field is zero. Moving from
        C to D brings mass $m$ farther away from the nearby side of the shell, but closer to
        the far side, and the cancellation between these two effects turns out to be perfect.
        Although the gravitational field has to be zero at the center due to symmetry, it's
        much more surprising that it cancels out perfectly in the whole interior region; this is a special
        mathematical characteristic of a $1/r$ interaction like gravity.

the earth, $g= v^2/ r= 2.72\times10^{-3}\ \munit/\sunit^2$,
which is 3600 times smaller than the gravitational field at the earth's surface.
The center-to-center distance from the moon to the earth is 60 times greater than the
radius of the earth. The earth is, to a very good approximation, a sphere made up
of concentric shells, each with uniform density, so 
the shell theorem tells us that its external gravitational field is the same as if all its
mass was concentrated at its center. We already know that a gravitational energy
that varies as $-1/ r$ is equivalent to a gravitational field proportional to
$1/ r^2$, so it makes sense that a distance that is greater by a factor
of 60 corresponds to a gravitational field that is $60\times60$=3600
times weaker. Note that the calculation didn't require knowledge of the earth's
mass or the gravitational constant, which Newton didn't know.

In 1665, shortly after Newton graduated from Cambridge,  the Great Plague forced
the college to close for two years, and Newton returned to the family farm and worked
intensely on scientific problems. During this productive period, he carried out this
calculation, but it came out wrong, causing him to doubt his new theory of gravity.
The problem was that during the plague years, he was unable to use the university's
library, so he had to use a figure for the radius of the moon's orbit that he had
memorized, and he forgot that the memorized value was in units of nautical miles
rather than statute miles. Once he realized his mistake, he found that the calculation
came out just right, and became confident that his theory was right after all.
\footnote{Some historians
are suspicious that the story of the apple and the mistake in conversions may have been
fabricated by Newton later in life. The conversion incident may have been a way of
explaining his long delay in publishing his work, which led to a conflict with
Leibniz over priority in the invention of calculus.}

\egquestion
Once Cavendish had found
$G= 6.67\times10^{-11}\ \zu{J}\cdot\zu{m}/\zu{kg}^2$
(p. \pageref{eg:cavendish}, example \ref{eg:cavendish}), it became possible to
determine the mass of the earth. By the shell theorem, the gravitational energy
of a mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of the earth is $U=- GMm/ r$,
where $M$ is the mass of the earth. The gravitational field is related to this by
$ mg\der{} r=\der{} U$, or
$g=(1/ m)\der{} U/\der{} r= GM/ r^2$.
Solving for $M$, we have 
\begin{align*}
         M        &=  gr^2/ G \\
                        & = \frac{\zu{(9.8\ }\zu{m}/\zu{s}^2\zu{)}

\begin{eg}{Gravity inside the earth}\label{eg:gravityinearth}
\egquestion
The earth is somewhat more dense at greater depths, but as an approximation let's
assume it has a constant density throughout. How does its internal gravitational
field vary with the distance $r$ from the center?

\eganswer
Let's write $b$ for the radius of the earth. The shell theorem tell us that at a
given location $r$, we only need to consider the mass $M_{< r}$
that is deeper than $r$.
Under the assumption of constant density,
this mass is related to the total mass of the earth by
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{ M_{< r}}{ M} = \frac{ r^3}{\zu{b}^3}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
and by the same reasoning as in example \ref{eg:weighearth},
\begin{equation*}
         g = \frac{ GM_{< r}}{ r^2}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
so
\begin{equation*}
         g = \frac{ GMr}{ b^3}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
In other words, the gravitational field interpolates linearly between zero at
$r=0$ and its ordinary surface value at $r= b$.

        The following example applies the numerical techniques of section
        \ref{numsection}.

\begin{eg}{From the earth to the moon}
The Apollo 11 mission landed the first humans on the moon in 1969.
In this example, we'll estimate the time it took to get to the moon, and compare
our estimate with the actual time, which was 73.0708 hours from the engine
burn that took the ship out of earth orbit to the engine burn that inserted it into
lunar orbit. During this time, the ship was coasting with the engines off, except
for a small course-correction burn, which we neglect. More importantly, we
do the calculation for a straight-line trajectory rather than the real S-shaped one,
so the result can only be expected to agree roughly with what really happened.
The following data come from the original press kit, which NASA has scanned and
posted on the Web:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
        \qquad initial altitude & $ 3.363\times10^5\ \zu{m}$\\
        \qquad initial velocity & $ 1.083\times10^4\ \zu{m/s}$\\
\end{tabular}\\
The endpoint of the the straight-line trajectory is a free-fall impact on
the lunar surface, which is also unrealistic (luckily for the astronauts).

        The ship's energy is
        \begin{align*}
                 E        &= -\frac{ GM_{e} m}{ r}
                                        -\frac{ GM_{m} m}{ r_{m}- r}
                                        +\frac{1}{2} mv^2\eqquad,
        \intertext{but since everything is proportional to the mass of the ship,  m,
                we can divide it out}
                \frac{ E}{ m}        &= -\frac{ GM_{e}}{ r}
                                        -\frac{ GM_{m}}{ r_{m}- r}

        the ship would have had so much kinetic energy that in the absence of any further

        Variety is the spice of life, not of science. So far this
        chapter has focused on heat energy, kinetic energy, and
        gravitational energy, but it might seem that in addition to
        these there is a bewildering array of other forms of
        energy. Gasoline, chocolate bars, batteries, melting water ---
        in each case there seems to be a whole new type of energy.
        The physicist's psyche rebels
        against the prospect of a long laundry list of types of
        energy, each of which would require
        its own equations,
        concepts, notation, and terminology. The point at which
        we've arrived in the study of energy is analogous to the
        period in the 1960's when a half a dozen new subatomic
        particles were being discovered every year in particle
        accelerators. It was an embarrassment. Physicists began to
        speak of the ``particle zoo,'' and it seemed that the
        subatomic world was distressingly complex. The particle zoo
        was simplified by the realization that most of the new
        particles being whipped up were simply clusters of a
        previously unsuspected set of fundamental particles
        (which were whimsically dubbed quarks, a made-up word
        from a line of poetry by James Joyce, ``Three quarks for
        Master Mark.'') The energy zoo can also be simplified, and
        it's the purpose of this section to demonstrate the hidden
        similarities between forms of energy as seemingly different
        as heat and motion.

<% begin_sec("Heat is kinetic energy.") %>

What is heat really? Is it an invisible fluid that your bare
feet soak up from a hot sidewalk? Can one ever remove all
the heat from an object? Is there a maximum to the
temperature scale?

The theory of heat as a fluid seemed to
explain why colder objects absorbed heat from hotter ones,
but once it became clear that heat was a form of energy, it
began to seem unlikely that a material substance could
transform itself into and out of all those other forms of
energy like motion or light. For instance, a compost pile
gets hot, and we describe this as a case where, through the
action of bacteria, chemical energy stored in the plant
cuttings is transformed into heat energy. The heating occurs
even if there is no nearby warmer object that could have
been leaking ``heat fluid'' into the pile.

An alternative
interpretation of heat was suggested by the theory that
matter is made of atoms. Since gases are thousands of times
less dense than solids or liquids, the atoms (or clusters of
atoms called molecules) in a gas must be far apart. In that
case, what is keeping all the air molecules from settling
into a thin film on the floor of the room in which you are
reading this book? The simplest explanation is that they are
moving very rapidly, continually ricocheting off of the
floor, walls, and ceiling. Though bizarre, the
cloud-of-bullets image of a gas did give a natural
explanation for the surprising ability of something as
tenuous as a gas to exert huge forces.

The
experiment shown in figure \figref{can-imploding}, for instance, can be explained as
follows. The high temperature of the steam is interpreted
as
a high average speed of random motions of its molecules.
Before
the lid was put on the can, the rapidly moving steam
molecules pushed their way out of the can, forcing the
slower air molecules out of the way. As the steam inside the
can thinned out, a stable situation was soon achieved, in
which the force from the less dense steam molecules moving
at high speed balanced against the force from the more dense
but slower air molecules outside. The cap was put on, and
after a while the steam inside the can began to cool off.
The force from the cooler, thin steam no longer matched the
force from the cool, dense air outside, and the imbalance of
forces crushed the can.

This type of
observation leads naturally to the conclusion that hotter
matter differs from colder in that its atoms' random motion
is more rapid. In a liquid, the motion could be visualized
as people in a milling crowd shoving past each other more
quickly. In a solid, where the atoms are packed together,
the motion is a random vibration of each atom as it knocks
against its neighbors.  

We thus achieve a great
simplification in the theory of heat. Heat is simply a form
of kinetic energy, the total kinetic energy of random motion
of all the atoms in an object. With this new understanding,
it becomes possible to answer at one stroke the questions
posed at the beginning of the section. Yes, it is at least
theoretically possible to remove all the heat from an
object. The coldest possible temperature, known as absolute
zero, is that at which all the atoms have zero velocity, so
that their kinetic energies, $K=(1/2)mv^2$, are all zero. No, there is no
maximum amount of heat that a certain quantity of matter can
have, and no maximum to the temperature scale, since
arbitrarily large values of $v$ can create arbitrarily large
amounts of kinetic energy per atom.  

The kinetic theory of
heat also provides a simple explanation of the true nature
of temperature. Temperature is a measure of the amount of
energy per molecule, whereas heat is the total amount of
energy possessed by all the molecules in an object.  

There is
an entire branch of physics, called thermodynamics, that
deals with heat and temperature and forms the basis for
technologies such as refrigeration. Thermodynamics is
discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:thermo}, and I've
provided here only a brief overview of the thermodynamic
concepts that relate directly to energy.

If I stretch the spring in figure \figref{spring} and then release it, it snaps
taut
again. The creation of some kinetic energy shows that there must have been some
other form of energy that was destroyed. What was it?

<% end_marg %>

We could just invent a new
type of energy called ``spring energy,'' study its behavior, and call it quits, but that
would be ugly. Are we going to have to invent a new forms of energy like this,
over and over? No: the title of this book doesn't lie, and physics really is fundamentally
simple. As shown in figure \figref{atomic}, when we bend or stretch an object, we're
really changing the distances between the atoms, resulting in a change in electrical
energy. Electrical energy isn't really our topic right now --- that's what most of the
second half of this book is about --- but conceptually it's very similar to gravitational
energy. Like gravitational energy, it depends on $1/r$, although there are some
interesting new phenomena, such as the existence of both attraction and repulsion,
which doesn't occur with gravity because gravitational mass can't be negative.
The real point is that all the apparently dissimilar forms of energy in figure
\figref{atomic} turn out to be due to electrical interactions among atoms.
Even if we wish to include nuclear reactions (figure \figref{fission}) in the
picture, there still turn out to be only four fundamental types of energy:

\myindented{6mm}{
        \noindent\textbf{kinetic energy} (including heat)\\
        \textbf{gravitational energy}\\
        \textbf{electrical and magnetic energy}\\
        \textbf{nuclear energy}
}

Astute students have often asked me how light fits into this picture. This is a very
good question, and in fact it could be argued that it is the basic question that led
to Einstein's theory of relativity as well as the modern quantum picture of nature.
Since these are topics for the second half of the book, we'll have to be content
with half an answer at this point. For now, we may think of light energy as a form
of kinetic energy, but one calculated not according to $(1/2)mv^2$ but by
some other equation. (We know that $(1/2)mv^2$ would not make sense, because
light has no mass, and furthermore, high-energy beams of light do not differ in
speed from low-energy ones.)

\begin{eg}{Temperature during boiling}
\egquestion
If you stick a thermometer in a pan of water, and watch the temperature as you
bring the water to a boil, you'll notice an interesting fact. The temperature
goes up until the boiling point is reached, but then stays at $100\degcunit$ during the
whole time the water is being boiled off. The temperature of the steam is also $100\degcunit$.
Why does the temperature ``stick'' like this? What's happening to all the energy that
the stove's burner is putting into the pan?

\eganswer
As shown in figure \figref{atomic}, boiling requires an increase in electrical
energy, because the atoms coming out as gas are moving away from the other atoms,
which attract them electrically. It is only this electrical energy that is increasing,
not the atoms' kinetic energy, which is what the thermometer can measure.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Diffusion}
\egquestion
A drop of food coloring in a cup of water will gradually spread out, even if
you don't do any mixing with a spoon. This is called diffusion.
Why would this happen, and what effect
would temperature have? What would happen with solids or gases?

\eganswer
Figure \figref{random-motion} shows that the atoms in a liquid mingle because
of their random thermal motion. Diffusion is slow (typically on the
order of a centimeter a minute), despite
the \emph{high} speeds of the atoms (typically hundreds of miles per
hour). This is due to the randomness of the motion: a particular atom
will take a long time to travel any significant distance, because it doesn't
travel in a straight line.

Based on this picture, we expect that the speed of diffusion should increase
as a function of temperature, and experiments show that this is true.

Diffusion also occurs in gases, which is why you can smell things even when
the air is still. The speeds are much faster, because the typical distance
between collisions is much longer than in a liquid.

We can see from figure \figref{random-motion} that diffusion won't occur
in solids, because each atom vibrates around an equilibrium position.

Let's revisit the example of the stretched spring from the previous section.
We know that its energy is a form of electrical energy of interacting atoms, which is nice
conceptually but doesn't help us to solve problems, since we don't
know how the energy, $U$, depends on the length of the spring. All we know is
that there's an equilibrium (figure \figref{mass-on-spring}/1), which is
a local minimum of the function $U$. An extremely important problem which arises
in this connection is how to calculate oscillatory motion around an equilibrium,
as in \figref{mass-on-spring}/4-13. Even if we did special experiments to find out
how the spring's energy worked, it might seem like we'd have to go through just
as much work to deal with any other kind of oscillation, such as a sapling swinging back
and forth in the breeze.

Surprisingly, it's possible to analyze this type of oscillation in a very general and
elegant manner, as long as the analysis is limited to \emph{small} oscillations.
We'll talk about the mass on the spring for concreteness, but there will be nothing
in the discussion at all that is restricted to that particular physical system.
First, let's choose a coordinate system in which $x=0$ corresponds to the
position of the mass where the spring is in equilibrium, and since interaction
energies like $U$ are only well defined up to an additive constant, we'll simply
define it to be zero at equilibrium:
\begin{equation*}
        U(0) = 0
\end{equation*}
Since $x=0$ is an equilibrium, $U(x)$ must have a local minimum there, and
a differentiable function (which we assume $U$ is) has a zero derivative at
a local minimum:
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\der{}U}{\der{}x}(0) = 0
\end{equation*}
There are still infinitely many functions that could satisfy these criteria,
including the three shown in figure \figref{curvature}, which are
$x^2/2$, $x^2/2(1+x^2)$, and $(e^{3x}+e^{-3x}-2)/18$. Note,
however, how all three functions are virtually identical right near the
minimum. That's because they all have the same curvature. More specifically,
each function has its second derivative equal to 1 at $x=0$, and the second
derivative is a measure of curvature. We write $k$ for the second derivative
of the energy at an equilibrium point,
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\der{}^2U}{\der{}x^2}(0) = k\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Physically, $k$ is a measure of stiffness. For example, the heavy-duty springs
in a car's shock absorbers would have a high value of $k$. It is often referred to as
the spring constant\index{spring constant}, but we're only using a spring as
an example here. As shown in figure
\figref{curvature}, any two functions that have $U(0)=0$, $\der{}U/\der{}x=0$, and
$\der{}^2U/\der{}x^2=k$, with the same value of $k$, are virtually indistinguishable
for small values of $x$, so if we want to analyze small oscillations, it doesn't even
matter which function we assume. For simplicity, we'll just use $U(x)=(1/2)kx^2$
from now on.  

Now we're ready to analyze the mass-on-a-spring system, while keeping in mind
that it's really only a representative example of a whole class of similar
oscillating systems. We expect that the motion is going to repeat itself over
and over again, and since we're not going to include frictional heating in our
model, that repetition should go on forever without dying out. The most interesting
thing to know about the motion would be the period, $T$, which is
the amount of time required for one
complete cycle of the motion. We might expect that the period would depend on
the spring constant, $k$, the mass, $m$, and and the amplitude,\index{amplitude}
$A$, defined in figure \figref{amplitude}.\footnote{Many kinds of oscillations are
possible, so there is no standard definition of the amplitude. For a pendulum, the
natural definition would be in terms of an angle. For a radio transmitter, we'd use
some kind of electrical units.}

In examples like the brachistochrone and the Apollo 11 mission, it was generally
necessary to use numerical techniques to determine the amount of time required
for a certain motion. Once again, let's dust off the \verb-time3- function
from page \pageref{time3listing} and modify it for our purposes. For flexibility,
we'll define the function $U(x)$ as a separate Python function. We really want
to calculate the time required for the mass to come back to its starting point, but
that would be awkward to set up, since our function works by dividing up the
distance to be traveled into tiny segments. By symmetry, the time required to
go from one end to the other equals the time required to come back to the start,
so we'll just calculate the time for half a cycle and then double it when we return
the result at the end of the function. The test at lines 16-19 is necessary because
otherwise at the very end of the motion we can end up trying to take the square
root of a negative number due to rounding errors.

        The first thing to notice is that with this particular set of inputs ($m$=1 kg,
        $k=1\ \junit/\munit^2$, and $A=1\ \munit$), the program has done an excellent
        job of computing $2\pi=6.2831853\ldots$. This is Mother Nature giving us
        a strong hint that the problem has an algebraic solution, not just a numerical
        one. The next interesting thing happens when we change the amplitude from
        1 m to 2 m:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> print(osc(1.,1.,2.,100000))
warning, K= -5.7482907323e-12 <0

        \noindent{}Even though the mass had to travel double the distance in each direction,
        the period is the same to within the numerical accuracy of the calculation!

With these hints, it seems like we should start looking for an algebraic solution. For guidance,
here's a graph of $x$ as a function of $t$, as calculated by the \verb-osc- function
with \verb-n-=10.

This looks like a cosine function, so let's see if a $x=A\cos{}(\omega{}t+\delta)$
is a solution to the conservation of energy equation ---
 it's not uncommon to try to ``reverse-engineer'' the cryptic results
of a numerical calculation like this.
The symbol $\omega=2\pi/T$ (Greek omega), called angular frequency,\index{angular frequency} is a standard symbol for
the number of radians per second of oscillation. Except for the factor of $2\pi$, 
it is identical to the ordinary frequency $f=1/T$,\index{frequency} which has units of $\sunit^{-1}$ or Hz (Hertz).
The phase angle
$\delta$ is to allow for the possibility that $t=0$ doesn't coincide with the
beginning of the motion. The energy is
\begin{align*}
        E        &= K + U \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{\der{}x}{\der{}t}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}m\left[-A\omega\sin{}(\omega{}t+\delta)\right]^2
                                 + \frac{1}{2}k\left[A\cos{}(\omega{}t+\delta)\right]^2 \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}A^2\left[m\omega^2\sin{}^2(\omega{}t+\delta)
                                 + k\cos{}^2(\omega{}t+\delta)\right] 
\end{align*}
According to conservation of energy, this has to be a constant. Using the identity
$\sin^2+\cos^2=1$, we can see that it will be a constant if we have $m\omega^2=k$,
or $\omega=\sqrt{k/m}$, i.e., $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$. Note that the period is independent
of amplitude.\label{shm-k-m}

\begin{eg}{A spring and a lever}\label{eg:leverspring}
\egquestion
What is the period of small oscillations of the system shown in the figure?
Neglect the mass of the lever and the spring. Assume that the spring is
so stiff that gravity is not an important effect. The spring is relaxed
when the lever is vertical.

\eganswer
This is a little tricky, because the spring constant $k$, although it
is relevant, is \emph{not} the $k$ we should be putting into the equation
$T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$. The $k$ that goes in there has to be the second
derivative of $U$ with respect to the position, $x$, of the mass that's
moving. The energy $U$ stored in the spring depends on how far the
\emph{tip} of the lever is from the center. This distance equals
$(L/b)x$, so the energy in the spring is
\begin{align*}
        U        &= \frac{1}{2}k\left(\frac{L}{b}x\right)^2 \\
                &= \frac{kL^2}{2b^2}x^2\eqquad, \\
\end{align*}
and the $k$ we have to put in $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$ is
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\der^2 U}{\der x^2}        =  \frac{kL^2}{b^2}\eqquad. \\
\end{equation*}
The result is
\begin{align*}
        T        &=  2\pi\sqrt{\frac{mb^2}{kL^2}} \\
                &=  \frac{2\pi b}{L}\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \\
\end{align*}
The leverage of the lever makes it as if the spring was stronger, and 
decreases the period of the oscillations by a factor of $b/L$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Water in a U-shaped tube}
\egquestion
What is the period of oscillation of the water in figure \figref{utube2}?

\eganswer
In example \ref{eg:utube1} on p. \pageref{eg:utube1}, we 
found $U( y)=\rho gAy^2$, so the ``spring constant,'' which really
isn't a spring constant here at all, is
\begin{align*}
         k        &= \frac{\zu{d}^2 U}{\zu{d} y^2} \\
                        &= 2\rho gA\eqquad.
\end{align*}
This is an interesting example, because $k$ can be calculated without any
approximations, but the kinetic energy requires an approximation, because we
don't know the details of the pattern of flow of the water. It could be very complicated.
There will be a tendency for the water near the walls to flow more slowly due to
friction, and there may also be swirling, turbulent motion. However, if we make
the approximation that all the water moves with the same velocity as the surface,
$\zu{d} y/\zu{d} t$, then the mass-on-a-spring analysis applies. Letting
$L$ be the total length of the filled part of the tube, the mass is $\rho LA$, and
we have
\begin{align*}
         T        &= 2\pi\sqrt{ m/ k} \\
                        &= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{\rho LA}{2\rho gA}} \\
                        &= 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{ L}{2 g}}\eqquad.
\end{align*}

You have probably bounced a ping pong ball straight up and
down in the air. The time between hits is related to the
height to which you hit the ball. If you take twice as much
time between hits, how many times higher do you think you
will have to hit the ball? Write down your hypothesis:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Your instructor will first beat out a tempo of 240 beats per
minute (four beats per second), which you should try to
match with the ping-pong ball. Measure the height to which
the ball rises:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now try it at 120 beats per minute:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Compare your hypothesis and your results with the rest of the class.

\extitle{B}{The Shell Theorem}

This exercise is an approximate numerical test of the shell
theorem. There are seven masses A-G, each being one
kilogram. Masses A-E, each one meter from the center, form a
shape like two Egyptian pyramids joined at their bases; this
is a rough approximation to a six-kilogram spherical shell
of mass. Mass G is five meters from the center of the main
group. The class will divide into six groups and split up
the work required in order to calculate the total gravitational energy
of mass G.

\includegraphics[width=78mm]{\chapdir/figs/ex-octahedron}

1. Each group should write its results on the board in units
of picojoules, retaining six significant figures of precision.

2. The class will add the results and compare with
the result that would be obtained with the shell theorem.

\noindent Equipment:

\item air track and carts of two different masses
\item springs
\item weights
\end{itemize}

\inlinefignocaptionnoresize{vibrations}

\noindent Place the cart on the air track and attach springs so that it can vibrate.

1. Test whether the period of vibration depends on amplitude. Try at
least one moderate amplitude, for which the springs do not go slack,
at least one amplitude that is large enough so that they do go
slack, and one amplitude that's the very smallest you can possibly observe.

2. Try a cart with a different mass. Does the period change by the
expected factor, based on the equation $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$?

3. In homework problem \ref{hw:hangfromspring} on page \pageref{hw:hangfromspring},
you showed that a spring's spring constant can be determined by hanging a weight from it.
Use this technique to find the spring constant of each of the two springs. The equivalent spring
constant of these two springs, attached to the cart in this way, can be found by adding their
spring constants.

4. Test the equation $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$ numerically.
