\epigraph{Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of
the two has the grander view?}{Victor Hugo}\index{Hugo, Victor}

His father died during his mother's pregnancy. Rejected by
her as a boy, he was packed off to boarding school when she
remarried. He himself never married, but in middle age he
formed an intense relationship with a much younger man, a
relationship that he terminated when he underwent a
psychotic break. Following his early scientific successes,
he spent the rest of his professional life mostly in
frustration over his inability to unlock the secrets of alchemy.

The man being described is Isaac Newton, but not the
triumphant \index{Newton, Isaac!alchemy}Newton of the standard
textbook hagiography. Why dwell on the sad side of his life?
To the modern science educator, Newton's lifelong obsession
with alchemy may seem an embarrassment, a distraction from
his main achievement, the creation of the modern science of
mechanics. To Newton, however, his alchemical researches
were naturally related to his investigations of force and
motion. What was radical about Newton's analysis of motion
was its universality: it succeeded in describing both the
heavens and the earth with the same equations, whereas
previously it had been assumed that the sun, moon, stars,
and planets were fundamentally different from earthly
objects. But Newton realized that if science was to describe
all of nature in a unified way, it was not enough to unite
the human scale with the scale of the universe: he would not
be satisfied until he fit the microscopic universe into
the picture as well.

It should not surprise us that Newton failed. Although he
was a firm believer in the existence of atoms, there was no
more experimental evidence for their existence than there
had been when the ancient Greeks first posited them on
purely philosophical grounds. \index{alchemy}Alchemy labored
under a tradition of secrecy and mysticism. Newton had
already almost single-handedly transformed the fuzzyheaded
field of ``natural philosophy'' into something we would
recognize as the modern science of physics, and it would be
unjust to criticize him for failing to change alchemy into
modern chemistry as well. The time was not ripe. The
microscope was a new invention, and it was cutting-edge
science when Newton's contemporary \index{Hooke}Hooke
discovered that living things were made out of cells.

<% begin_sec("Newton's quest") %>

Nevertheless it will be instructive to pick up Newton's
train of thought and see where it leads us with the benefit
of modern hindsight. In uniting the human and cosmic scales
of existence, he had reimagined both as stages on which the
actors were objects (trees and houses, planets and stars)
that interacted through attractions and repulsions. He was
already convinced that the objects inhabiting the microworld
were atoms, so it remained only to determine what kinds of
forces they exerted on each other.

His next insight was no less brilliant for his inability to
bring it to fruition. He realized that the many human-scale
forces --- friction, sticky forces, the normal forces that
keep objects from occupying the same space, and so on ---
must all simply be expressions of a more fundamental force
acting between atoms. Tape sticks to paper because the atoms
in the tape attract the atoms in the paper. My house doesn't
fall to the center of the earth because its atoms repel the
atoms of the dirt under it.

Here he got stuck. It was tempting to think that the atomic
force was a form of gravity, which he knew to be universal,
fundamental, and mathematically simple. Gravity, however, is
always attractive, so how could he use it to explain the
existence of both attractive and repulsive atomic forces?
The gravitational force between objects of ordinary size is
also extremely small, which is why we never notice cars and
houses attracting us gravitationally. It would be hard to
understand how gravity could be responsible for anything as
vigorous as the beating of a heart or the explosion of
gunpowder. Newton went on to write a million words of
alchemical notes filled with speculation about some other
force, perhaps a ``divine force'' or ``vegetative force''
that would for example be carried by the sperm to the egg.

<% end_marg %>

Luckily, we now know enough to investigate a different
suspect as a candidate for the atomic force: electricity.
\index{electric forces}Electric forces are often observed
between objects that have been prepared by rubbing (or other
surface interactions), for instance when clothes rub against
each other in the dryer. A useful example is shown in figure
\figref{twotapes}/1: stick two pieces of tape on a tabletop, and then put
two more pieces on top of them. Lift each pair from the
table, and then separate them. The two top pieces will then
repel each other, \figref{twotapes}/2, as will the two bottom pieces. A
bottom piece will attract a top piece, however, \figref{twotapes}/3.
Electrical forces like these are similar in certain ways to
gravity, the other force that we already know to be fundamental:

\begin{itemize}
\item Electrical forces are \emph{universal}. Although some
substances, such as fur, rubber, and plastic, respond more
strongly to electrical preparation than others, all matter
participates in electrical forces to some degree. There is
no such thing as a ``nonelectric'' substance. Matter is both
inherently gravitational and inherently electrical.

\item Experiments show that the electrical force, like the
gravitational force, is an \emph{inverse square} force. That
is, the electrical force between two spheres is proportional
to $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the center-to-center distance between them.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, electrical forces make more sense than gravity
as candidates for the fundamental force between atoms,
because we have observed that they can be either attractive or repulsive.

<% begin_sec("Charge, electricity and magnetism") %>

<% begin_sec("Charge") %>

``\index{charge}Charge'' is the technical term used to
indicate that an object has been prepared so as to
participate in electrical forces. This is to be distinguished
from the common usage, in which the term is used indiscriminately
for anything electrical. For example, although we speak
colloquially of ``charging'' a battery, you may easily
verify that a battery has no charge in the technical sense,
e.g., it does not exert any electrical force on a piece of
tape that has been prepared as described in the previous section.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Two types of charge") %>

We can easily collect reams of data on electrical forces
between different substances that have been charged in
different ways. We find for example that cat fur prepared by
rubbing against rabbit fur will attract glass that has been
rubbed on silk. How can we make any sense of all this
information? A vast simplification is achieved by noting
that there are really only two types of charge. Suppose we
pick cat fur rubbed on rabbit fur as a representative of
type A, and glass rubbed on silk for type B. We will now
find that there is no ``type C.'' Any object electrified by
any method is either A-like, attracting things A attracts
and repelling those it repels, or B-like, displaying the
same attractions and repulsions as B. The two types, A and
B, always display opposite interactions. If A displays an
attraction with some charged object, then B is guaranteed
to undergo repulsion with it, and vice-versa.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("The coulomb") %>
\index{coulomb (unit)}

Although there are only two types of charge, each type can
come in different amounts. The metric unit of charge is the
coulomb (rhymes with ``drool on''), defined as follows:

\begin{lessimportant}
One Coulomb (C) is the amount of charge such that
a force of $9.0\times10^9$ N occurs between two pointlike
objects with charges of 1 C separated by a distance of 1 m.
\end{lessimportant}

The notation for an amount of charge is $q$. The numerical
factor in the definition is historical in origin, and is not
worth memorizing. The definition is stated for pointlike,
i.e., very small, objects, because otherwise different parts
of them would be at different distances from each other.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("A model of two types of charged particles") %>

Experiments show that all the methods of rubbing or
otherwise charging objects involve two objects, and both of
them end up getting charged. If one object acquires a
certain amount of one type of charge, then the other ends up
with an equal amount of the other type. Various interpretations
of this are possible, but the simplest is that the basic
building blocks of matter come in two flavors, one with each
type of charge. Rubbing objects together results in the
transfer of some of these particles from one object to the
other. In this model, an object that has not been electrically
prepared may actually possesses a great deal of \emph{both}
types of charge, but the amounts are equal and they are
distributed in the same way throughout it. Since type A
repels anything that type B attracts, and vice versa, the
object will make a total force of zero on any other object.
The rest of this chapter fleshes out this model and
discusses how these mysterious particles can be understood
as being internal parts of atoms.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Use of positive and negative signs for charge") %>

Because the two types of charge tend to cancel out each
other's forces, it makes sense to label them using positive
and negative signs, and to discuss the \emph{total} charge
of an object. It is entirely arbitrary which type of charge
to call negative and which to call positive. Benjamin
\index{Franklin, Benjamin!definition of signs of charge}Franklin
decided to describe the one we've been calling ``A'' as
negative, but it really doesn't matter as long as everyone
is consistent with everyone else. An object with a total
charge of zero (equal amounts of both types) is referred to
as electrically $\index{neutral (electrically)}neutral$.

\index{Coulomb's law}
A large body of experimental observations can be summarized as follows:  

\begin{important}
Coulomb's law: The magnitude of the force acting between pointlike charged
objects at a center-to-center distance $r$ is given by the equation
\begin{equation*}
                |\vc{F}|        =    k\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}\eqquad,  
\end{equation*}
where the constant $k$ equals $9.0\times10^9\ \zu{N}\unitdot\zu{m}^2/\zu{C}^2$.
The force is attractive if the charges are of different
signs, and repulsive if they have the same sign.
\end{important}

Clever modern techniques have allowed the $1/r^2$ form of
Coulomb's law to be tested to incredible accuracy, showing
that the exponent is in the range from 1.9999999999999998
to 2.0000000000000002.

Note that Coulomb's law is closely analogous to Newton's law
of gravity, where the magnitude of the force is $Gm_1m_2/r^2$, except
that there is only one type of mass, not two, and gravitational
forces are never repulsive. Because of this close analogy
between the two types of forces, we can recycle a great deal
of our knowledge of gravitational forces. For instance,
there is an electrical equivalent of the shell theorem: the
electrical forces exerted externally by a uniformly charged
spherical shell are the same as if all the charge was
concentrated at its center, and the forces exerted
internally are zero.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Conservation of charge") %>
\index{charge!conservation of}

An even more fundamental reason for using positive and
negative signs for electrical charge is that experiments
show that charge is conserved according to this definition:
in any closed system, the total amount of charge is a
constant. This is why we observe that rubbing initially
uncharged substances together always has the result that one
gains a certain amount of one type of charge, while the
other acquires an equal amount of the other type. Conservation
of charge seems natural in our model in which matter is made
of positive and negative particles. If the charge on each
particle is a fixed property of that type of particle, and
if the particles themselves can be neither created nor
destroyed, then conservation of charge is inevitable.

As shown in figure \figref{scrapsofpaper}, an electrically charged object can
attract objects that are uncharged. How is this possible?
The key is that even though each piece of paper has a total
charge of zero, it has at least some charged particles in it
that have some freedom to move. Suppose that the tape is
positively charged, \figref{induction}. Mobile particles in the paper will
respond to the tape's forces, causing one end of the paper to
become negatively charged and the other to become positive.
The attraction between the paper and the tape is now
stronger than the repulsion, because the negatively charged
end is closer to the tape.

We have begun to encounter complex electrical behavior that
we would never have realized was occurring just from the
evidence of our eyes. Unlike the pulleys, blocks, and
inclined planes of mechanics, the actors on the stage of
electricity and magnetism are invisible phenomena alien to
our everyday experience. For this reason, the flavor of the
second half of your physics education is dramatically
different, focusing much more on experiments and techniques.
Even though you will never actually see charge moving
through a wire, you can learn to use an ammeter to measure the flow.

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

Students also tend to get the impression from their first
semester of physics that it is a dead science. Not so! We
are about to pick up the historical trail that leads
directly to the cutting-edge physics research you read about
in the newspaper. The atom-smashing experiments that began
around 1900, which we will be studying in this chapter,
were not that different from the ones of the year 2000 ---
just smaller, simpler, and much cheaper.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Magnetic forces") %>

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

A detailed mathematical treatment of magnetism won't come
until much later in this book, but we need to develop a few
simple ideas about magnetism now because magnetic forces are
used in the experiments and techniques we come to next.
Everyday magnets come in two general types. Permanent
magnets, such as the ones on your refrigerator, are made of
iron or substances like steel that contain iron atoms.
(Certain other substances also work, but iron is the
cheapest and most common.) The other type of magnet, an
example of which is the ones that make your stereo speakers
vibrate, consist of coils of wire through which electric
charge flows. Both types of magnets are able to attract iron
that has not been magnetically prepared, for instance the
door of the refrigerator.  

A single insight makes these apparently complex phenomena
much simpler to understand: magnetic forces are interactions
between moving charges, occurring in addition to the
electric forces. Suppose a permanent magnet is brought near
a magnet of the coiled-wire type. The coiled wire has moving
charges in it because we force charge to flow. The permanent
magnet also has moving charges in it, but in this case the
charges that naturally swirl around inside the iron. (What
makes a magnetized piece of iron different from a block of
wood is that the motion of the charge in the wood is random
rather than organized.) The moving charges in the coiled-wire
magnet exert a force on the moving charges in the permanent
magnet, and vice-versa.

The mathematics of magnetism is significantly more complex
than the Coulomb force law for electricity, which is why we
will wait until chapter \ref{ch:em} before delving deeply into it. Two
simple facts will suffice for now:

(1) If a charged particle is moving in a region of space
near where other charged particles are also moving, their
magnetic force on it is directly proportional to its velocity.

(2) The magnetic force on a moving charged particle is
always perpendicular to the direction the particle is moving.

\begin{eg}{A magnetic compass}
        The Earth is molten inside, and like a pot of boiling water,
        it roils and churns. To make a drastic oversimplification,
        electric charge can get carried along with the churning
        motion, so the Earth contains moving charge. The needle of a
        magnetic compass is itself a small permanent magnet. The
        moving charge inside the earth interacts magnetically with
        the moving charge inside the compass needle, causing the
compass needle to twist around and point north.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A television tube}
A TV picture is painted by a stream of electrons coming from
the back of the tube to the front. The beam scans across the
whole surface of the tube like a reader scanning a page of a
book. Magnetic forces are used to steer the beam. As the
beam comes from the back of the tube to the front, up-down
and left-right forces are needed for steering. But magnetic
forces cannot be used to get the beam up to speed in the
first place, since they can only push perpendicular to the
electrons' direction of motion, not forward along it.
\end{eg}

\startdqs

\begin{dq}
        If the electrical attraction between two pointlike
        objects at a distance of 1 m is $9\times10^9$ N, why can't
        we infer that their charges are $+1$ and $-1$ C? What further
        observations would we need to do in order to prove this?

\index{Atomism}

The Greeks have been kicked around a lot in the last couple
of millennia: dominated by the Romans, bullied during the
crusades by warlords going to and from the Holy Land, and
occupied by Turkey until recently. It's no wonder they
prefer to remember their salad days, when their best
thinkers came up with concepts like democracy and atoms.
Greece is democratic again after a period of military
dictatorship, and an \index{atom}atom is proudly pictured on
one of their coins. That's why it hurts me to have to say
that the ancient Greek hypothesis that matter is made of
atoms was pure guesswork. There was no real experimental
evidence for atoms, and the 18th-century revival of the atom
concept by Dalton owed little to the Greeks other than the
name, which means ``unsplittable.'' Subtracting even more
cruelly from Greek glory, the name was shown to be
inappropriate in 1897 when physicist J.J. Thomson proved
experimentally that atoms had even smaller things inside
them, which could be extracted. (Thomson called them
``electrons.'') The ``unsplittable'' was splittable after all.

But that's getting ahead of our story. What happened to the
atom concept in the intervening two thousand years? Educated
people continued to discuss the idea, and those who were in
favor of it could often use it to give plausible explanations
for various facts and phenomena. One fact that was readily
explained was conservation of mass. For example, if you mix
1 kg of water with 1 kg of dirt, you get exactly 2 kg of
mud, no more and no less. The same is true for the a variety
of processes such as freezing of water, fermenting beer, or
pulverizing sandstone. If you believed in atoms, \index{conservation
of mass}conservation of \index{mass!conservation of}mass
made perfect sense, because all these processes could be
interpreted as mixing and rearranging atoms, without
changing the total number of atoms. Still, this is nothing
like a proof that atoms exist.

If atoms did exist, what types of atoms were there, and what
distinguished the different types from each other? Was it
their sizes, their shapes, their weights, or some other
quality? The chasm between the ancient and modern atomisms
becomes evident when we consider the wild speculations that
existed on these issues until the present century. The
ancients decided that there were four types of atoms, earth,
water, air and fire; the most popular view was that they
were distinguished by their shapes. Water atoms were
spherical, hence water's ability to flow smoothly. Fire
atoms had sharp points, which was why fire hurt when it
touched one's skin. (There was no concept of temperature
until thousands of years later.) The drastically different
modern understanding of the structure of atoms was achieved
in the course of the revolutionary decade stretching 1895 to
1905. The main purpose of this chapter is to describe
those momentous experiments.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Atoms, light, and everything else") %>

Although I tend to ridicule ancient Greek philosophers like
Aristotle, let's take a moment to praise him for something.
If you read Aristotle's writings on physics (or just skim
them, which is all I've done), the most striking thing is
how careful he is about classifying phenomena and analyzing
relationships among phenomena. The human brain seems to
naturally make a distinction between two types of physical
phenomena: objects and motion of objects. When a phenomenon
occurs that does not immediately present itself as one of
these, there is a strong tendency to conceptualize it as one
or the other, or even to ignore its existence completely.
For instance, physics teachers shudder at students'
statements that ``the dynamite exploded, and force came out
of it in all directions.'' In these examples, the nonmaterial
concept of force is being mentally categorized as if it was
a physical substance. The statement that ``winding the clock
stores motion in the spring'' is a miscategorization of
electrical energy as a form of motion. An example of ignoring
the existence of a phenomenon altogether can be elicited by
asking people why we need lamps. The typical response that
``the lamp illuminates the room so we can see things,''
ignores the necessary role of light coming into our eyes
from the things being illuminated.

If you ask someone to tell you briefly about atoms, the
likely response is that ``everything is made of atoms,'' but
we've now seen that it's far from obvious which ``everything''
this statement would properly refer to. For the scientists
of the early 1900s who were trying to investigate atoms,
this was not a trivial issue of definitions. There was a new
gizmo called the vacuum tube, of which the only familiar
example today is the picture tube of a TV. In short order,
electrical tinkerers had discovered a whole flock of new
phenomena that occurred in and around vacuum tubes, and
given them picturesque names like ``x-rays,'' ``cathode
rays,'' ``Hertzian waves,'' and ``N-rays.'' These were the
types of observations that ended up telling us that we know
about matter, but fierce controversies ensued over whether
these were themselves forms of matter.

Let's bring ourselves up to the level of classification of
phenomena employed by physicists in the year 1900. They
 recognized three categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item \index{matter!defined} \emph{Matter} has mass, can have kinetic
energy, and can travel through a vacuum, transporting its
mass and kinetic energy with it. Matter is conserved, both
in the sense of conservation of mass and conservation of the
number of atoms of each element. Atoms can't occupy the same
space as other atoms, so a convenient way to prove something
is not a form of matter is to show that it can pass through
a solid material, in which the atoms are packed together closely.

\item  \index{light!defined} \emph{Light} has no mass, always has energy,
and can travel through a vacuum, transporting its energy
with it. Two light beams can penetrate through each other
and emerge from the collision without being weakened,
deflected, or affected in any other way. Light can penetrate
certain kinds of matter, e.g., glass.

\item  The third category is everything that doesn't fit the
definition of light or matter. This catch-all category
includes, for example, time, velocity, heat, and force.
\end{itemize}

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("The chemical elements") %>
\index{elements, chemical}

How would one find out what types of atoms there were?
Today, it doesn't seem like it should have been very
difficult to work out an experimental program to classify
the types of atoms. For each type of atom, there should be a
corresponding element, i.e., a pure substance made out of
nothing but that type of atom. Atoms are supposed to be
unsplittable, so a substance like milk could not possibly be
elemental, since churning it vigorously causes it to split
up into two separate substances: butter and whey. Similarly,
rust could not be an element, because it can be made by
combining two substances: iron and oxygen. Despite its
apparent reasonableness, no such program was carried out
until the eighteenth century. The ancients presumably did
not do it because observation was not universally agreed on
as the right way to answer questions about nature, and also
because they lacked the necessary techniques or the
techniques were the province of laborers with low social
status, such as smiths and miners. 
Alchemists were hindered by atomism's reputation for
subversiveness, and by a tendency toward mysticism and
secrecy. (The most celebrated challenge facing the
alchemists, that of converting lead into gold, is one we now
know to be impossible, since lead and gold are both elements.)

By 1900, however, chemists had done a reasonably good job of
finding out what the elements were. They also had determined
the ratios of the different atoms' masses fairly accurately.
A typical technique would be to measure how many grams of
sodium (Na) would combine with one gram of chlorine (Cl) to
make salt (NaCl). (This assumes you've already decided based
on other evidence that salt consisted of equal numbers of Na
and Cl atoms.) The masses of individual atoms, as opposed to
the mass ratios, were known only to within a few orders of
magnitude based on indirect evidence, and plenty of
physicists and chemists denied that individual atoms were
anything more than convenient symbols.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Making sense of the elements") %>

As the information accumulated, the challenge was to find a
way of systematizing it; the modern scientist's aesthetic
sense rebels against complication. This hodgepodge of
elements was an embarrassment. One contemporary observer,
William \index{Crookes, William}Crookes, described the
elements as extending ``before us as stretched the wide
Atlantic before the gaze of Columbus, mocking, taunting and
murmuring strange riddles, which no man has yet been able to
solve.'' It wasn't long before people started recognizing
that many atoms' masses were nearly integer multiples of the
mass of hydrogen, the lightest element. A few excitable
types began speculating that hydrogen was the basic building
block, and that the heavier elements were made of clusters
of hydrogen. It wasn't long, however, before their parade
was rained on by more accurate measurements, which showed
that not all of the elements had atomic masses that were
near integer multiples of hydrogen, and even the ones that
were close to being integer multiples were off by one percent or so.

Chemistry professor Dmitri \index{Mendeleev, Dmitri}Mendeleev,
preparing his lectures in 1869, wanted to find some way to
organize his knowledge for his students to make it more
understandable. He wrote the names of all the elements on
cards and began arranging them in different ways on his
desk, trying to find an arrangement that would make sense of
the muddle. The row-and-column scheme he came up with is
essentially our modern periodic table. The columns of the
modern version represent groups of elements with similar
chemical properties, and each row is more massive than the
one above it. Going across each row, this almost always
resulted in placing the atoms in sequence by weight as well.
What made the system significant was its predictive value.
There were three places where Mendeleev had to leave gaps in
his checkerboard to keep chemically similar elements in the
same column. He predicted that elements would exist to fill
these gaps, and extrapolated or interpolated from other
elements in the same column to predict their numerical
properties, such as masses, boiling points, and densities.
Mendeleev's professional stock skyrocketed when his three
elements (later named gallium, scandium and germanium) were
discovered and found to have very nearly the properties he had predicted.

One thing that Mendeleev's table made clear was that mass
was not the basic property that distinguished atoms of
different elements. To make his table work, he had to
deviate from ordering the elements strictly by mass. For
instance, iodine atoms are lighter than tellurium, but
Mendeleev had to put iodine after tellurium so that it would
lie in a column with chemically similar elements.

The success of the kinetic theory of heat was taken as
strong evidence that, in addition to the motion of any
object as a whole, there is an invisible type of motion all
around us: the random motion of atoms within each object.
But many conservatives were not convinced that atoms really
existed. Nobody had ever seen one, after all. It wasn't
until generations after the kinetic theory of heat was
developed that it was demonstrated conclusively that atoms
really existed and that they participated in continuous
motion that never died out.

The smoking gun to prove atoms were more than mathematical
abstractions came when some old, obscure observations were
reexamined by an unknown Swiss patent clerk named Albert
Einstein. A botanist named \index{Brownian motion}Brown,
using a microscope that was state of the art in 1827,
observed tiny grains of pollen in a drop of water on a
microscope slide, and found that they jumped around randomly
for no apparent reason. Wondering at first if the pollen
he'd assumed to be dead was actually alive, he tried looking
at particles of soot, and found that the soot particles also
moved around. The same results would occur with any small
grain or particle suspended in a liquid. The phenomenon came
to be referred to as Brownian motion, and its existence was
filed away as a quaint and thoroughly unimportant fact,
really just a nuisance for the microscopist.

It wasn't until 1906 that \index{Einstein, Albert!and
Brownian motion}Einstein found the correct interpretation
for Brown's observation: the water molecules were in
continuous random motion, and were colliding with the
particle all the time, kicking it in random directions.
After all the millennia of speculation about atoms, at last
there was solid proof. Einstein's calculations dispelled all
doubt, since he was able to make accurate predictions of
things like the average distance traveled by the particle in
a certain amount of time.  (Einstein received the Nobel
Prize not for his theory of relativity but for his papers on
Brownian motion and the photoelectric effect.)

        Proving that atoms actually existed was a big accomplishment,
        but demonstrating their existence was different from
        understanding their properties. Note that the Brown-Einstein
        observations had nothing at all to do with electricity, and
        yet we know that matter is inherently electrical, and we

Strong support for the charged-particle model came from a
1911 experiment by physicist Robert \index{Millikan,
Robert}Millikan at the University of Chicago. Consider a jet
of droplets of perfume or some other liquid made by blowing
it through a tiny pinhole. The droplets emerging from the
pinhole must be smaller than the pinhole, and in fact most
of them are even more microscopic than that, since the
turbulent flow of air tends to break them up. Millikan
reasoned that the droplets would acquire a little bit of
electric charge as they rubbed against the channel through
which they emerged, and if the charged-particle model of
electricity was right, the charge might be split up among so
many minuscule liquid drops that a single drop might have a
total charge amounting to an excess of only a few charged
particles --- perhaps an excess of one positive particle on
a certain drop, or an excess of two negative ones on another.

Millikan's ingenious apparatus, \figref{oildrop},
consisted of two metal plates, which could be electrically
charged as needed. He sprayed a cloud of oil droplets into
the space between the plates, and selected one drop through
a microscope for study. First, with no charge on the plates,
he would determine the drop's mass by letting it fall
through the air and measuring its terminal velocity, i.e.,
the velocity at which the force of air friction canceled out
the force of gravity. The force of air drag on a slowly
moving sphere had already been found by experiment to be
$bvr^2$, where $b$ was a constant.
Setting the total force equal to zero when the drop is at
terminal velocity gives
\begin{equation*}
           bvr^2 - mg = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
and setting the known density of oil equal to the drop's
mass divided by its volume gives a second equation,
\begin{equation*}
           \rho = \frac{m}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Everything in these equations can be measured directly
except for $m$ and $r$, so these are two equations in two
unknowns, which can be solved in order to determine
how big the drop is.

Next Millikan charged the metal plates, adjusting the amount
of charge so as to exactly counteract gravity and levitate
the drop. If, for instance, the drop being examined happened
to have a total charge that was negative, then positive
charge put on the top plate would attract it, pulling it up,
and negative charge on the bottom plate would repel it,
pushing it up. (Theoretically only one plate would be
necessary, but in practice a two-plate arrangement like this
gave electrical forces that were more uniform in strength
throughout the space where the oil drops were.) The amount
of charge on the plates required to levitate the charged
drop gave Millikan a handle on the amount of charge the drop
carried. The more charge the drop had, the stronger the
electrical forces on it would be, and the less charge would
have to be put on the plates to do the trick. Unfortunately,
expressing this relationship using Coulomb's law would have
been impractical, because it would require a perfect
knowledge of how the charge was distributed on each plate,
plus the ability to perform vector addition of all the
forces being exerted on the drop by all the charges on the
plate. Instead, Millikan made use of the fact that the
electrical force experienced by a pointlike charged object
at a certain point in space is proportional to its charge,
\begin{equation*}
           \frac{F}{q} = \text{constant}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
With a given amount of charge on the plates, this constant
could be determined for instance by discarding the oil drop,
inserting between the plates a larger and more easily
handled object with a known charge on it, and measuring the
force with conventional methods. (Millikan actually used a
slightly different set of techniques for determining the
constant, but the concept is the same.) The amount of force
on the actual oil drop had to equal $mg$, since it was
just enough to levitate it, and once the calibration
constant had been determined, the charge of the drop could
then be found based on its previously determined mass.

The table on the left shows a few of the results from
Millikan's 1911 paper. (Millikan took data on both
negatively and positively charged drops, but in his paper he
gave only a sample of his data on negatively charged drops,
so these numbers are all negative.) Even a quick look at the
data leads to the suspicion that the charges are not simply
a series of random numbers. For instance, the second charge
is almost exactly equal to half the first one. Millikan
explained the observed charges as all being integer
multiples of a single number, $1.64\times10^{-19}$ C. In the
second column, dividing by this constant gives numbers that
are essentially integers, allowing for the random errors
present in the experiment. Millikan states in his paper that
these results were a

\begin{quote}
\ldots direct and tangible demonstration \ldots of the correctness of
the view advanced many years ago and supported by evidence
from many sources that all electrical charges, however
produced, are exact multiples of one definite, elementary
electrical charge, or in other words, that an electrical
charge instead of being spread uniformly over the charged
surface has a definite granular structure, consisting, in
fact, of \ldots specks, or atoms of electricity, all precisely
alike, peppered over the surface of the charged body.
\end{quote}

In other words, he had provided direct evidence for the
charged-particle model of electricity and against models in
which electricity was described as some sort of fluid. The
basic charge is notated $e$, and the modern value is
$e=1.60\times10^{-19}$ C.
The word ``\emph{quantized}'' is used in physics to describe
a quantity that can only have certain numerical values, and
cannot have any of the values between those. In this
language, we would say that Millikan discovered that charge
is quantized. The charge $e$ is referred to as the quantum of charge.

<% begin_sec("A historical note on Millikan's fraud") %>

Very few undergraduate physics textbooks mention
 the well-documented fact that although
Millikan's conclusions were correct, he was guilty of scientific
fraud. His technique was difficult and painstaking to perform, and his
original notebooks, which have been preserved, show that the data were
far less perfect than he claimed in his published scientific papers.
In his publications, he stated categorically that every single oil
drop observed had had a charge that was a multiple of $e$, with no
exceptions or omissions. But his notebooks are replete with notations
such as ``beautiful data, keep,'' and ``bad run, throw out.'' Millikan,
then, appears to have earned his Nobel Prize by advocating a correct
position with dishonest descriptions of his data.

Why do textbook
authors fail to mention Millikan's fraud? It may be that they think
students are too unsophisticated to correctly evaluate the
implications of the fact that scientific fraud has sometimes existed
and even been rewarded by the scientific establishment. Maybe they are
afraid students will reason that fudging data is OK, since Millikan
got the Nobel Prize for it. But falsifying history in the name of
encouraging truthfulness is more than a little ironic. English
teachers don't edit Shakespeare's tragedies so that the bad characters
are always punished and the good ones never suffer!

\index{cathode rays}

Nineteenth-century physicists spent a lot of
time trying to come up with wild, random ways to play with
electricity. The best experiments of this kind were the ones
that made big sparks or pretty colors of light.

One such parlor trick was the cathode ray. To produce it,
you first had to hire a good glassblower and find a good
vacuum pump. The glassblower would create a hollow tube and
embed two pieces of metal in it, called the electrodes,
which were connected to the outside via metal wires passing
through the glass. Before letting him seal up the whole
tube, you would hook it up to a vacuum pump, and spend
several hours huffing and puffing away at the pump's hand
crank to get a good vacuum inside. Then, while you were
still pumping on the tube, the glassblower  would melt the
glass and seal the whole thing shut. Finally, you would put
a large amount of positive charge on one wire and a large
amount of negative charge on the other. Metals have the
property of letting charge move through them easily, so the
charge deposited on one of the wires would quickly spread
out because of the repulsion of each part of it for every
other part. This spreading-out process would result in
nearly all the charge ending up in the electrodes, where
there is more room to spread out than there is in the wire.
For obscure historical reasons a negative electrode is
called a cathode and a positive one is an anode.

Figure \figref{crt} shows the light-emitting stream that was
observed. If, as shown in this figure, a hole was made in
the anode, the beam would extend on through the hole until
it hit the glass. Drilling a hole in the cathode, however
would not result in any beam coming out on the left side,
and this indicated that the stuff, whatever it was, was
coming from the cathode. The rays were therefore christened
``cathode rays.'' (The terminology is still used today in
the term ``cathode ray tube'' or ``CRT'' for the picture
tube of a TV or computer monitor.)

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Were cathode rays a form of light, or of matter?") %>

Were cathode rays a form of light, or matter? At first no
one really cared what they were, but as their scientific
importance became more apparent, the light-versus-matter
issue turned into a controversy along nationalistic lines,
with the Germans advocating light and the English holding
out for matter. The supporters of the material interpretation
imagined the rays as consisting of a stream of atoms ripped
from the substance of the cathode.

One of our defining characteristics of matter is that
material objects cannot pass through each other. Experiments
showed that cathode rays could penetrate at least some small
thickness of matter, such as a metal foil a tenth of a
millimeter thick, implying that they were a form of light.

Other experiments, however, pointed to the contrary
conclusion. Light is a wave phenomenon, and one distinguishing
property of waves is demonstrated by speaking into one end of a
paper towel roll. The sound waves do not emerge from the
other end of the tube as a focused beam. Instead, they begin
spreading out in all directions as soon as they emerge. This
shows that waves do not necessarily travel in straight
lines. If a piece of metal foil in the shape of a star or a
cross was placed in the way of the cathode ray, then a
``shadow'' of the same shape would appear on the glass,
showing that the rays traveled in straight lines. This
straight-line motion suggested that they were a stream of
small particles of matter.  

These observations were inconclusive, so what was really
needed was a determination of whether the rays had mass and
weight. The trouble was that cathode rays could not simply
be collected in a cup and put on a scale. When the cathode
ray tube is in operation, one does not observe any loss of
material from the cathode, or any crust being deposited on the anode.

 Nobody could think of a good way to weigh cathode rays, so
the next most obvious way of settling the light/matter
debate was to check whether the cathode rays possessed
electrical charge. Light was known to be uncharged. If the
cathode rays carried charge, they were definitely matter and
not light, and they were presumably being made to jump the
gap by the simultaneous repulsion of the negative charge in
the cathode and attraction of the positive charge in the
anode. The rays would overshoot the anode because of their
momentum. (Although electrically charged particles do not
normally leap across a gap of vacuum, very large amounts of
charge were being used, so the forces were unusually intense.)

Physicist J.J.~Thomson at Cambridge carried out a series of
definitive experiments on cathode rays around the year 1897.
By turning them slightly off course with electrical forces, \figref{deflect},
he showed that they were indeed
electrically charged, which was strong evidence that they
were material. Not only that, but he proved that they had
mass, and measured the ratio of their mass to their charge,
$m/q$. Since their mass was not zero, he concluded that they
were a form of matter, and presumably made up of a stream of
microscopic, negatively charged particles. When Millikan
published his results fourteen years later, it was
reasonable to assume that the charge of one such particle
equaled minus one fundamental charge, $q=-e$, and from the
combination of Thomson's and Millikan's results one could
therefore determine the mass of a single cathode ray particle.

%>

The basic technique for determining $m/q$ was simply to
measure the angle through which the charged plates bent the
beam. The electric force acting on a cathode ray particle
while it was between the plates would be proportional to its charge,
\begin{equation*}
                F_{elec}        = \text{(known constant)} \cdot q\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}

Application of Newton's second law, $a=F/m$, would allow
$m/q$ to be determined:

\begin{equation*}
                \frac{m}{q}        =      \frac{\text{known constant}}{a}
\end{equation*}

There was just one catch. Thomson needed to know the cathode
ray particles' velocity in order to figure out their
acceleration. At that point, however, nobody had even an
educated guess as to the speed of the cathode rays produced
in a given vacuum tube. The beam appeared to leap across the
vacuum tube practically instantaneously, so it was no simple
matter of timing it with a stopwatch!

Thomson's clever solution was to observe the effect of both
electric and magnetic forces on the beam. The magnetic force
exerted by a particular magnet would depend on both the
cathode ray's charge and its velocity:
\begin{equation*}
                F_{mag}        =      \text{(known constant \#2)} \cdot qv
\end{equation*}

Thomson played with the electric and magnetic forces until
either one would produce an equal effect on the beam,
allowing him to solve for the velocity,

\begin{equation*}
                v    =     \frac{\text{(known constant)}}{\text{(known constant \#2)}}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}

Knowing the velocity (which was on the order of 10\% of the
speed of light for his setup), he was able to find the
acceleration and thus the mass-to-charge ratio $m/q$.
Thomson's techniques were relatively crude (or perhaps more
charitably we could say that they stretched the state of the
art of the time), so with various methods he came up with
$m/q$ values that ranged over about a factor of two, even
for cathode rays extracted from a cathode made of a single
material. The best modern value is
$m/q=5.69\times10^{-12}$ kg/C, which is consistent with the low
end of Thomson's range.

<% begin_sec("The cathode ray as a subatomic particle: the electron") %>
\index{electron}

What was significant about Thomson's experiment was not the
actual numerical value of $m/q$, however, so much as the
fact that, combined with Millikan's value of the fundamental
charge, it gave a mass for the cathode ray particles that
was thousands of times smaller than the mass of even the
lightest atoms. Even without Millikan's results, which were
14 years in the future, Thomson recognized that the cathode
rays' $m/q$ was thousands of times smaller than the
$m/q$ ratios that had been measured for electrically charged
atoms in chemical solutions. He correctly interpreted this
as evidence that the cathode rays were smaller building
blocks --- he called them \emph{electrons} --- out of which
atoms themselves were formed. This was an extremely radical
claim, coming at a time when atoms had not yet been proven
to exist! Even those who used the word ``atom'' often
considered them no more than mathematical abstractions, not
literal objects. The idea of searching for structure inside
of ``unsplittable'' atoms was seen by some as lunacy, but
within ten years Thomson's ideas had been amply verified by
many more detailed experiments.

        Thomson started to become convinced during his experiments
        that the ``cathode rays'' observed coming from the cathodes
        of vacuum tubes were building blocks of atoms --- what we
        now call electrons. He then carried out observations with
        cathodes made of a variety of metals, and found that $m/q$
        was roughly the same in every case, considering his limited
        accuracy. Given his suspicion, why did it make sense to try
        different metals? How would the consistent values of $m/q$
        serve to test his hypothesis?

\begin{dq}
        Thomson found that the $m/q$ of an electron was thousands

%>
<% end_marg %>

Based on his experiments, Thomson proposed a picture of the
atom which became known as the \index{atom!raisin-cookie
model of}\index{raisin cookie model}raisin cookie model.
In the neutral atom, \figref{raisincookie}, there are four
electrons with a total charge of $-4e$, sitting in a sphere
(the ``cookie'') with a charge of $+4e$ spread throughout
it. It was known that chemical reactions could not change
one element into another, so in Thomson's scenario, each
element's cookie sphere had a permanently fixed radius,
mass, and positive charge, different from those of other
elements. The electrons, however, were not a permanent
feature of the atom, and could be tacked on or pulled out to
make charged ions. Although we now know, for instance, that
a neutral atom with four electrons is the element beryllium,
scientists at the time did not know how many electrons the
various neutral atoms possessed.

This model is clearly different from the one you've learned
in grade school or through popular culture, where the
positive charge is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the
atom's center. An equally important change in ideas about
the atom has been the realization that atoms and their
constituent subatomic particles behave entirely differently
from objects on the human scale. For instance, we'll see
later that an electron can be in more than one place at one
time. The raisin cookie model was part of a long tradition
of attempts to make mechanical models of phenomena, and
Thomson and his contemporaries never questioned the
appropriateness of building a mental model of an atom as a
machine with little parts inside. Today, mechanical models
of atoms are still used (for instance the tinker-toy-style
molecular modeling kits like the ones used by Watson and
Crick to figure out the double helix structure of DNA), but
scientists realize that the physical objects are only aids
to help our brains' symbolic and visual processes think about atoms.

Although there was no clear-cut experimental evidence for
many of the details of the raisin cookie model, physicists
went ahead and started working out its implications. For
instance, suppose you had a four-electron atom. All four
electrons would be repelling each other, but they would also
all be attracted toward the center of the ``cookie'' sphere.
The result should be some kind of stable, symmetric
arrangement in which all the forces canceled out. People
sufficiently clever with math soon showed that the electrons
in a four-electron atom should settle down at the vertices
of a pyramid with one less side than the Egyptian kind, i.e.,
a regular tetrahedron. This deduction turns out to be wrong
because it was based on incorrect features of the model, but
the model also had many successes, a few of which we will now discuss.

\begin{eg}{Flow of electrical charge in wires}
        One of my former students was the son of an electrician, and
had become an electrician himself. He related to me how his
father had remained refused to believe all his life that
electrons really flowed through wires. If they had, he
reasoned, the metal would have gradually become more and
more damaged, eventually crumbling to dust.

        His opinion is not at all unreasonable based on the fact
that electrons are material particles, and that matter
cannot normally pass through matter without making a hole
through it. Nineteenth-century physicists would have shared
his objection to a charged-particle model of the flow of
electrical charge. In the raisin-cookie model, however,
the electrons are very low in mass, and therefore presumably
very small in size as well. It is not surprising that they
can slip between the atoms without damaging them.
\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{Flow of electrical charge across cell membranes}
        Your nervous system is based on signals carried by charge
moving from nerve cell to nerve cell. Your body is
essentially all liquid, and atoms in a liquid are mobile.
This means that, unlike the case of charge flowing in a
solid wire, entire charged atoms can flow in your nervous system
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Emission of electrons in a cathode ray tube}
        Why do electrons detach themselves from the cathode of a
vacuum tube? Certainly they are encouraged to do so by the
repulsion of the negative charge placed on the cathode and
the attraction from the net positive charge of the anode,
but these are not strong enough to rip electrons out of
atoms by main force --- if they were, then the entire
apparatus would have been instantly vaporized as every atom
was simultaneously ripped apart!

        The raisin cookie model leads to a simple explanation. We
know that heat is the energy of random motion of atoms. The
atoms in any object are therefore violently jostling each
other all the time, and a few of these collisions are
violent enough to knock electrons out of atoms. If this
occurs near the surface of a solid object, the electron may
can come loose. Ordinarily, however, this loss of electrons
is a self-limiting process; the loss of electrons leaves the
object with a net positive charge, which attracts the lost
sheep home to the fold. (For objects immersed in air rather
than vacuum, there will also be a balanced exchange of
electrons between the air and the object.)

        This interpretation explains the warm and friendly yellow
glow of the vacuum tubes in an antique radio. To encourage
the emission of electrons from the vacuum tubes' cathodes,
the cathodes are intentionally warmed up with little heater coils.

\begin{dq}
        Today many people would define an ion as an atom (or
        molecule) with missing electrons or extra electrons added
        on. How would people have defined the word ``ion'' before
        the discovery of the electron?
\end{dq}

\begin{dq}
        Since electrically neutral atoms were known to exist,
        there had to be positively charged subatomic stuff to cancel
        out the negatively charged electrons in an atom. Based on
        the state of knowledge immediately after the Millikan and
        Thomson experiments, was it possible that the positively
        charged stuff had an unquantized amount of charge? Could it
        be quantized in units of +e? In units of +2e? In units of +5/7e?
