\extitle{A}{Exploring Images With a Curved Mirror}

\noindent Equipment:

\begin{indentedblock}
        concave mirrors with deep curvature

        concave mirrors with gentle curvature

        convex mirrors
\end{indentedblock}

1. Obtain a curved mirror from your instructor. If it is
silvered on both sides, make sure you're working with the
concave side, which bends light rays inward. Look at
your own face in the mirror. Now change the distance between
your face and the mirror, and see what happens. Explore the full range
of possible distances between your face and the mirror.

In these observations you've been changing two variables at once:
the distance between the object (your face) and the mirror, and the
distance from the mirror to your eye. In general, scientific experiments
become easier to interpret if we practice isolation of variables,
i.e., only change one variable while keeping all the others constant.
In parts 2 and 3 you'll form an image of an object that's not your face,
so that you can have independent control of the object distance and
the point of view.

2. With the mirror held far away from you, observe the image
of something behind you, over your shoulder. Now bring your
eye closer and closer to the mirror. Can you see the image
with your eye very close to the mirror? See if you can explain your
observation by drawing a ray diagram.

\vfill

\hfill --------------------$>$ \emph{turn page}

\pagebreak[4]

3. Now imagine the following new situation, but \emph{don't
actually do it yet}. Suppose you lay the mirror face-up on a
piece of tissue paper, put your finger a few cm above the
mirror, and look at the image of your finger. As in part 2,
you can bring your eye closer and closer to the mirror.

Will you be
able to see the image with your eye very close to the mirror?
Draw a ray diagram to help you predict what you will observe.

\vspace{85mm}

Prediction:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now test your prediction. If your prediction was incorrect,
see if you can figure out what went wrong, or ask your instructor for help.

4. For parts 4 and 5, it's more convenient to use concave mirrors that are
more gently curved; obtain one from your instructor.
Lay the mirror on the tissue paper, and use it to create
an image of the overhead lights on a piece of paper above it
and a little off to the side. What do you have to do in
order to make the image clear? Can you explain this observation using a ray diagram?

\vfill

\hfill --------------------$>$ \emph{turn page}

\pagebreak[4]

5. Now imagine the following experiment, but \emph{don't do
it yet}. What will happen to the image on the paper if you
cover half of the mirror with your hand?

Prediction:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Test your prediction. If your prediction was incorrect, can
you explain what happened?

6. Now imagine forming an image with a convex mirror (one that
bulges outward), and that therefore bends light rays away
from the central axis (i.e., is diverging). Draw a typical ray diagram.

\vspace{90mm}

Is the
image real, or virtual? Will there be more than one type of image?

Prediction:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Test your prediction.

\extitle{C}{How strong are your glasses?}

This exercise was created by Dan MacIsaac.

\noindent Equipment:

\begin{indentedblock}
        eyeglasses

        diverging lenses for students who don't wear glasses, or
who use  glasses with converging lenses

rulers and metersticks

scratch paper

        marking pens
\end{indentedblock}

Most people who wear glasses have glasses whose lenses are
outbending, which allows them to focus on objects far away.
Such a lens cannot form a real image, so its focal length
cannot be measured as easily as that of a converging lens.
In this exercise you will determine the focal length of your
own glasses by taking them off, holding them at a distance
from your face, and looking through them at a set of
parallel lines on a piece of paper. The lines will be
reduced (the lens's magnification is less than one), and by
adjusting the distance between the lens and the paper, you
can make the magnification equal 1/2 exactly, so that two
spaces between lines as seen through the lens fit into one
space as seen simultaneously to the side of the lens. This
object distance can be used in order to find the focal length of the lens.

1. Use a marker to draw three evenly spaced parallel lines
on the paper. (A spacing of a few cm works well.)

2. Does this technique really measure magnification or does
it measure angular magnification? What can you do in your
experiment in order to make these two quantities nearly the
same, so the math is simpler?

3. Before taking any numerical data, use algebra to find the
focal length of the lens in terms of $d_o$, the object
distance that results in a magnification of 1/2.

4. Measure the object distance that results in a magnification
of 1/2, and determine the focal length of your lens.

%====================================================================

\pagebreak[4]
\extitle{D}{Double-Source Interference}

1. Two sources separated by a distance $d=2$ cm make circular ripples
with a wavelength of $\lambda=1$ cm.
On a piece of paper, make a life-size drawing of the two
sources in the default setup, and locate the following points:

        A. The point that is 10 wavelengths from source \#1 and 10
wavelengths from source \#2.

B. The point that is 10.5 wavelengths from \#1 and 10.5 from \#2.

C. The point that is 11 wavelengths from \#1 and 11 from \#2.

D. The point that is 10 wavelengths from \#1 and 10.5 from \#2.

E. The point that is 11 wavelengths from \#1 and 11.5 from \#2.

F. The point that is 10 wavelengths from \#1 and 11 from \#2.

G. The point that is 11 wavelengths from \#1 and 12 from \#2.

You can do this either using a compass or by putting the
next page under your paper and tracing. It is not necessary to trace
all the arcs completely, and doing so is unnecessarily time-consuming;
you can fairly easily estimate where these points would lie, and just
trace arcs long enough to find the relevant intersections.

What do these points correspond to in the real wave pattern?

2. Make a fresh copy of your drawing, showing only point F
and the two sources, which form a long, skinny triangle. Now
suppose you were to change the setup by doubling
$d$, while leaving $\lambda $ the same. It's easiest to understand what's
happening on the drawing if you move both sources outward,
keeping the center fixed. Based on your drawing, what will
happen to the position of point F when you double $d$? How
has the angle of point F changed?

3. What would happen if you doubled \emph{both} $\lambda$ and $d$
compared to the standard setup?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4. Combining the ideas from parts 2 and 3, what
do you think would happen to your angles if, starting from
the standard setup, you doubled $\lambda $ while leaving $d$
the same?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5. Suppose $\lambda$ was a millionth of a centimeter, while
$d$ was still as in the standard setup. What would happen to
the angles? What does this tell you about observing
diffraction of light?

\extitle{E}{Single-slit diffraction}

\noindent Equipment:

\begin{indentedblock}
        rulers

        computer with web browser
\end{indentedblock}

The following page is a diagram of a single slit and a
screen onto which its diffraction pattern is projected. The
class will make a numerical prediction of the intensity of
the pattern at the different points on the screen. Each
group will be responsible for calculating the intensity at
one of the points. (Either 11 groups or six will work nicely
-- in the latter case, only points a, c, e, g, i,
and k are used.) The idea is to break up the wavefront in
the mouth of the slit into nine parts, each of which is
assumed to radiate semicircular ripples as in Huygens'
principle. The wavelength of the wave is 1 cm, and we assume
for simplicity that each set of ripples has an amplitude of
1 unit when it reaches the screen.

1. For simplicity, let's imagine that we were only to use
two sets of ripples rather than nine. You could measure the
distance from each of the two points inside the slit to your
point on the screen. Suppose the distances were both 25.0
cm. What would be the amplitude of the superimposed waves at
this point on the screen?

Suppose one distance was 24.0 cm and the other was 25.0
cm. What would happen?

What if one was 24.0 cm and the other was 26.0 cm?

What if one was 24.5 cm and the other was 25.0 cm?

In general, what combinations of distances will lead to
completely destructive and completely constructive interference?

Can you estimate the answer in the case where the distances
are 24.7 and 25.0 cm?

2. Although it is possible to calculate mathematically the
amplitude of the sine wave that results from superimposing
two sine waves with an arbitrary phase difference between
them, the algebra is rather laborious, and it become even
more tedious when we have more than two waves to superimpose.
Instead, one can simply use a computer spreadsheet or some
other computer program to add up the sine waves numerically
at a series of points covering one complete cycle. This is
what we will actually do. You just need to enter the
relevant data into the computer, then examine the results
and pick off the amplitude from the resulting list of numbers.
You can run the software through a web interface at 
\verb@http://lightandmatter.com/cgi-bin/diffraction1.cgi@.

3. Measure all nine distances to your group's point on the
screen, and write them on the board - that way everyone can
see everyone else's data, and the class can try to make
sense of why the results came out the way they did.
Determine the amplitude of the combined wave, and write it
on the board as well.

The class will discuss why the results came out the way they did.

\extitle{F}{Diffraction of Light}

\noindent Equipment:

\begin{indentedblock}
        slit patterns,
        lasers, 
        straight-filament bulbs
\end{indentedblock}

\formatlikesubsection{station 1}\\
You have a mask with a bunch of different double slits cut out of it. The values of w and d are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
pattern A & w=0.04 mm & d=.250 mm\\
pattern B & w=0.04 mm & d=.500 mm\\
pattern C & w=0.08 mm & d=.250 mm\\
pattern D & w=0.08 mm & d=.500 mm
\end{tabular}

\noindent Predict how the patterns will look different, and test your prediction. The easiest way to get the laser to point at different sets of slits is to stick folded up pieces of paper in one side or the other of the holders.

\formatlikesubsection{station 2}\\
This is just like station 1, but with single slits:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
pattern A & w=0.02 mm \\
pattern B & w=0.04 mm \\
pattern C & w=0.08 mm \\
pattern D & w=0.16 mm
\end{tabular}

\noindent Predict what will happen, and test your predictions. If you have time, check the actual numerical ratios of the w values against the ratios of the sizes of the diffraction patterns

\formatlikesubsection{station 3}\\
This is like station 1, but the only difference among the sets of  slits is how many slits there are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
pattern A & double slit\\
pattern B & 3 slits\\
pattern C & 4 slits\\
pattern D & 5 slits
\end{tabular}

\formatlikesubsection{station 4}\\
Hold the diffraction grating up to your eye, and look through it at the straight-filament light bulb. If you orient the grating correctly, you should be able to see the $m=1$ 
and $m=-1$ diffraction patterns off the left and right. If you have it oriented the wrong way, they'll be above and below the bulb instead, which is inconvenient
 because the bulb's filament is vertical. Where is the $m=0$ fringe? Can you see $m=2$, etc.?

\emph{Station 5 has the same equipment as station 4. If you're assigned to station 5 first, you should actually do activity 4 first, because it's easier.}

\formatlikesubsection{station 5}\\
Use the transformer to increase and decrease the voltage across the bulb. This allows 
you to control the filament's temperature. Sketch graphs of intensity as a function of wavelength for various temperatures. The
 inability of the wave model of light to explain the mathematical shapes of these curves was historically one of the reasons
 for creating a new model, in which light is both a particle and a wave.
