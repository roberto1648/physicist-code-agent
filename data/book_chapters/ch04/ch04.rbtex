``Sure, and maybe the sun won't come up tomorrow.'' Of
course, the sun only appears to go up and down because the
earth spins, so the cliche should really refer to the
unlikelihood of the earth's stopping its rotation abruptly
during the night. Why can't it stop? It wouldn't violate
conservation of momentum, because the earth's rotation
doesn't add anything to its momentum. While California spins
in one direction, some equally massive part of India goes
the opposite way, canceling its momentum. A halt to Earth's
rotation would entail a drop in kinetic energy, but that
energy could simply be converted into some other form, such
as heat.

Other examples along these lines are not hard to find. An
atom spins at the same rate for billions of years.
A high-diver who is rotating when he comes off the board
does not need to make any physical effort to continue
rotating, and indeed would be unable to stop rotating before
he hit the water.

These observations have the hallmarks of a conservation law:

\emph{A closed system is involved.} Nothing is making an effort to
twist the earth, the hydrogen atom, or the high-diver. They
are isolated from rotation-changing influences, i.e., they
are closed systems.

\emph{Something remains unchanged.} There appears to be a numerical
quantity for measuring rotational motion such that the total
amount of that quantity remains constant in a closed system.

\emph{Something can be transferred back and forth without changing
the total amount.} In the photo of the old-fashioned high
jump, \figref{highjump}, the jumper wants to get his feet out in front of
him so he can keep from doing a ``face plant'' when he
lands. Bringing his feet forward would involve a certain
quantity of counterclockwise rotation, but he didn't start
out with any rotation when he left the ground. Suppose we
consider counterclockwise as positive and clockwise as
negative. The only way his legs can acquire some positive
rotation is if some other part of his body picks up an equal
amount of negative rotation. This is why he swings his arms
up behind him, clockwise.

What numerical measure of rotational motion is conserved?
Car engines and old-fashioned LP records have speeds of
rotation measured in rotations per minute (r.p.m.), but the
number of rotations per minute (or per second) is not a
conserved quantity. A twirling figure skater, for instance,
can pull her arms in to increase her r.p.m.'s. The first
section of this chapter deals with the numerical definition
of the quantity of rotation that results in a valid
conservation law.

When most people think of rotation, they think of a solid
object like a wheel rotating in a circle around a fixed
point. Examples of this type of rotation, called rigid
rotation or rigid-body rotation, include a spinning top, a
seated child's swinging leg, and a helicopter's spinning
propeller. Rotation, however, is a much more general
phenomenon, and includes noncircular examples such as a
comet in an elliptical orbit around the sun, or a cyclone,
in which the core completes a circle more quickly than the
outer parts.

If there is a numerical measure of rotational motion that is
a conserved quantity, then it must include nonrigid cases
like these, since nonrigid rotation can be traded back and
forth with rigid rotation. For instance, there is a trick
for finding out if an egg is raw or hardboiled. If you spin
a hardboiled egg and then stop it briefly with your finger,
it stops dead. But if you do the same with a raw egg, it
springs back into rotation because the soft interior was
still swirling around within the momentarily motionless
shell. The pattern of flow of the liquid part is presumably
very complex and nonuniform due to the asymmetric shape of
the egg and the different consistencies of the yolk and the
white, but there is apparently some way to describe the
liquid's total amount of rotation with a single number, of
which some percentage is given back to the shell when you
release it.

The best strategy is to devise a way of defining the amount
of rotation of a single small part of a system. The amount
of rotation of a system such as a cyclone will then be
defined as the total of all the contributions from its many
small parts.

%>
<% end_marg %>

The quest for a conserved quantity of rotation even requires
us to broaden the rotation concept to include cases where
the motion doesn't repeat or even curve around. If you throw
a piece of putty at a door, \figref{putty}, the door will recoil and start
rotating. The putty was traveling straight, not in a circle,
but if there is to be a general conservation law that can
cover this situation, it appears that we must describe the
putty as having had some ``rotation,'' which it then gave up
to the door. The best way of thinking about it is to
attribute rotation to any moving object or part of an object
that changes its angle in relation to the axis of rotation.
In the putty-and-door example, the hinge of the door is the
natural point to think of as an axis, and the putty changes
its angle as seen by someone standing at the hinge, \figref{putty-angular}. For this
reason, the conserved quantity we are investigating is
called \emph{angular momentum}.\index{angular momentum}
 The symbol for angular momentum
can't be ``a'' or ``m,'' since those are used for
acceleration and mass, so the letter $L$ is arbitrarily chosen
instead.

<% end_marg %>

Imagine a 1 kg blob of putty, thrown at the door at a speed
of 1 m/s, which hits the door at a distance of 1 m from the
hinge. We define this blob to have 1 unit of angular
momentum. When it hits the door, the door will recoil and
start rotating. We can use the speed at which the door recoils as a measure
of the angular momentum the blob brought in.\footnote{We assume that the door is much
more massive than the blob. Under this assumption, the speed at which the
door recoils is much less than the original speed of the blob, so the blob
has lost essentially all its angular momentum, and given it to the door.}

Experiments show, not surprisingly, that a 2 kg blob thrown
in the same way makes the door rotate twice as fast, so the
angular momentum of the putty blob must be proportional to
mass,
\begin{equation*}
        L \propto m\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Similarly, experiments show that doubling the velocity of
the blob will have a doubling effect on the result,
so its angular momentum must be proportional to its velocity
as well,
\begin{equation*}
        L \propto mv\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

You have undoubtedly had the experience of approaching a
closed door with one of those bar-shaped handles on it and
pushing on the wrong side, the side close to the hinges. You
feel like an idiot, because you have so little leverage that
you can hardly budge the door. The same would be true with
the putty blob. Experiments would show that the amount of
rotation the blob can give to the door is proportional to
the distance, $r$, from the axis of rotation, so angular
momentum must be proportional to $r$ as well,
\begin{equation*}
        L \propto mvr\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

We are almost done, but there is one missing ingredient. We
know on grounds of symmetry that a putty ball thrown
directly inward toward the hinge will have no angular
momentum to give to the door. After all, there would not
even be any way to decide whether the ball's rotation was
clockwise or counterclockwise in this situation. It is
therefore only the component of the blob's velocity vector
perpendicular to the door that should be counted in its
angular momentum,
\begin{equation*}
        L = m v_{\perp} r\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
More generally, $v_{\perp}$ should be thought of as the
component of the object's velocity vector that is
perpendicular to the line joining the object to the axis of
rotation.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

We find that this equation agrees with the definition of the
original putty blob as having one unit of angular momentum,
and we can now see that the units of angular momentum are
$(\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit)\unitdot\munit$, i.e., 
$\kgunit\unitdot\munit^2/\sunit$. Summarizing, we
have\index{angular momentum!of a particle in two dimensions}
\begin{equation*}
        L = m v_{\perp} r \qquad
                 \text{[angular momentum of a particle in two dimensions]}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $m$ is the particle's mass, $v_{\perp}$ is the component of its
velocity vector perpendicular to the line joining it to the axis of
rotation, and $r$ is its distance from the axis. (Note that $r$ is not
necessarily the radius of a circle.)
Positive and negative
signs of angular momentum are used to describe opposite directions
of rotation. The angular momentum of a finite-sized object or a system
of many objects is found by dividing it up into many small parts, applying
the equation to each part, and adding to find the total amount of
angular momentum. (As
implied by the word ``particle,'' matter isn't the only thing that
can have angular momentum. Light can also have angular
momentum, and the above equation would not apply to 
light.)\index{angular momentum!of light}

Conservation of angular momentum has been verified over and
over again by experiment, and is now believed to be one of
the most fundamental principles of physics, along with
conservation of mass, energy, and momentum.

\begin{eg}{A figure skater pulls her arms in.}
When a figure skater is twirling, there is very little
friction between her and the ice, so she is essentially a
closed system, and her angular momentum is conserved. If she
pulls her arms in, she is decreasing $r$ for all the atoms in
her arms. It would violate conservation of angular momentum
if she then continued rotating at the same speed, i.e.,
taking the same amount of time for each revolution, because her
arms' contributions to her angular momentum would have
decreased, and no other part of her would have increased its
angular momentum. This is impossible because it would
violate conservation of angular momentum. If her total
angular momentum is to remain constant, the decrease in $r$
for her arms must be compensated for by an overall increase
in her rate of rotation. That is, by pulling her arms in,
she substantially reduces the time for each rotation.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Earth's slowing rotation and the receding moon}
The earth's rotation is actually
slowing down very gradually, with the kinetic energy being
dissipated as heat by friction between the land and the
tidal bulges raised in the seas by the earth's gravity. Does
this mean that angular momentum is not really perfectly
conserved? No, it just means that the earth is not quite a
closed system by itself. If we consider the earth and moon
as a system, then the angular momentum lost by the earth
must be gained by the moon somehow. In fact very precise
measurements of the distance between the earth and the moon
have been carried out by bouncing laser beams off of a
mirror left there by astronauts, and these measurements show
that the moon is receding from the earth at a rate of 4
centimeters per year! The moon's greater value of $r$ means
that it has a greater angular momentum, and the increase
turns out to be exactly the amount lost by the earth. In the
days of the dinosaurs, the days were significantly shorter,
and the moon was closer and appeared bigger in the sky.

But what force is causing the moon to speed up, drawing it
out into a larger orbit? It is the gravitational forces of
the earth's tidal bulges. In figure \figref{tidaleffects}, the
earth's rotation is counterclockwise
(arrow). The moon's gravity creates a bulge on the side near
it, because its gravitational pull is stronger there, and an
``anti-bulge'' on the far side, since its gravity there is
weaker. For simplicity, let's focus on the tidal bulge
closer to the moon. Its frictional force is trying to slow
down the earth's rotation, so its force on the earth's solid
crust is toward the bottom of the figure. By Newton's third
law, the crust must thus make a force on the bulge which is
toward the top of the figure. This causes the bulge to be
pulled forward at a slight angle, and the bulge's gravity
therefore pulls the moon forward, accelerating its orbital
motion about the earth and flinging it outward.

The result would
obviously be extremely difficult to calculate directly, and
this is one of those situations where a conservation law
allows us to make precise quantitative statements about the
outcome of a process when the calculation of the process
itself would be prohibitively complex.

Is angular momentum a vector, or a scalar? It does have a
direction in space, but it's a direction of rotation, not a
straight-line direction like the directions of vectors such
as velocity or force. It turns out that there is a way of
defining angular momentum as a vector, but in this section the
examples will be confined to a single plane of rotation,
i.e., effectively two-dimensional situations. In this special
case, we can choose to visualize the plane of rotation from
one side or the other, and to define clockwise and
counterclockwise rotation as having opposite signs of
angular momentum. ``Effectively'' two-dimensional
means that we can deal with objects that aren't flat,
as long as the velocity vectors of all their parts lie
in a plane.

\startdqs

\begin{dq}
Conservation of plain old momentum, $p$, can be thought of
as the greatly expanded and modified descendant of Galileo's
original principle of inertia, that no force is required to
keep an object in motion. The principle of inertia is
counterintuitive, and there are many situations in which it
appears superficially that a force \emph{is} needed to
maintain motion, as maintained by Aristotle. Think of a
situation in which conservation of angular momentum, $L$,
also seems to be violated, making it seem incorrectly that
something external must act on a closed system to keep its
angular momentum from ``running down.''

<% begin_sec("Application to planetary motion",nil,'ang-mom-planetary') %>

We now discuss the application of conservation of angular
momentum to planetary motion, both because of its intrinsic
importance and because it is a good way to develop a visual
intuition for angular momentum.

Kepler's law of equal areas states that the area swept out
by a planet in a certain length of time is always the same.
Angular momentum had not been invented in Kepler's time, and
he did not even know the most basic physical  facts about
the forces at work. He thought of this law as an entirely
empirical and unexpectedly simple way of summarizing his
data, a rule that succeeded in describing and predicting how
the planets sped up and slowed down in their elliptical
paths. It is now fairly simple, however, to show that the
equal area law amounts to a statement that the planet's
angular momentum stays constant.

<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'area-swept-out',
    %q{The area swept out by a planet in its orbit.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

There is no simple geometrical rule for the area of a pie
wedge cut out of an ellipse, but if we consider a very short
time interval, as shown in figure \figref{area-swept-out}, the shaded shape
swept out by the planet is very nearly a triangle. We do
know how to compute the area of a triangle. It is one half
the product of the base and the height:
\begin{equation*}
        \zu{area}        =   \frac{1}{2}bh\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We wish to relate this to angular momentum, which contains
the variables $r$ and $v_{\perp}$. If we consider the sun to be
the axis of rotation, then the variable $r$ is identical to
the base of the triangle, $r=b$. Referring to the magnified
portion of the figure, $v_{\perp}$ can be related to $h$,
because the two right triangles are similar:
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{h}{\zu{distance traveled}} = \frac{v_{\perp}}{|\vc{v}|}
\end{equation*}
The area can thus be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
        \zu{area}        =  \frac{1}{2}r\frac{v_{\perp}(\zu{distance traveled})}{|\vc{v}|}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The distance traveled equals $|\vc{v}|\Delta t$, so this simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
        \zu{area}        =  \frac{1}{2}rv_{\perp}\Delta t\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We have found the following relationship between angular
momentum and the rate at which area is swept
out:
\begin{equation*}
        L        =   2m \frac{\zu{area}}{\Delta t}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The factor of 2 in front is simply a matter of convention,
since any conserved quantity would be an equally valid
conserved quantity if you multiplied it by a constant. The
factor of $m$ was not relevant to Kepler, who did not know the
planets' masses, and who was only describing the motion of
one planet at a time.

We thus find that Kepler's equal-area law is equivalent to a
statement that the planet's angular momentum remains
constant. But wait, why should it remain constant? --- the
planet is not a closed system, since it is being acted on by
the sun's gravitational force. There are two valid answers.
The first is that it is actually the total angular momentum
of the sun plus the planet that is conserved. The sun,
however, is millions of times more massive than the typical
planet, so it accelerates very little in response to the
planet's gravitational force. It is thus a good
approximation to say that the sun doesn't move at all, so
that no angular momentum is transferred between it and the
planet.

The second answer is that to change the planet's angular
momentum requires not just a force but a force applied in a
certain way. Later in this section (starting on page \pageref{subsec:torque})
 we discuss the transfer of
angular momentum by a force, but the basic idea here is that
a force directly in toward the axis does not change the
angular momentum.

<% begin_sec("Two theorems about angular momentum",nil,'ang-mom-theorems') %>

With plain old momentum, $\vc{p}$, we had the freedom to work in
any inertial frame of reference we liked. The same object
could have different values of momentum in two different
frames, if the frames were not at rest with respect to each
other. Conservation of momentum, however, would be true in
either frame. As long as we employed a single frame
consistently throughout a calculation, everything would
work.

The same is true for angular momentum, and in addition there
is an ambiguity that arises from the definition of an axis
of rotation. For a wheel, the natural choice of an axis of
rotation is obviously the axle, but what about an egg
rotating on its side? The egg has an asymmetric shape, and
thus no clearly defined geometric center. A similar issue
arises for a cyclone, which does not even have a sharply
defined shape, or for a complicated machine with many gears.
The following theorem, the first of two presented in this
section, explains how to deal with this issue.
Although I have put descriptive titles above both theorems,
they have no generally accepted names. The proofs,
given on page \pageref{choiceofaxisproof}, use the
vector cross-product technique introduced in
section \ref{sec:amthreed}, which greatly simplifies them.

\mythmhdr{The choice of axis theorem} It is entirely arbitrary what
point one defines as the axis for purposes of calculating angular
momentum. If a closed system's angular momentum is conserved
when calculated with one choice of axis, then it will be conserved
for any other choice of axis. Likewise, any inertial frame of reference
may be used. The theorem also holds in the case where the system is not
closed, but the total external force is zero.\index{choice of axis theorem}

\begin{eg}{Colliding asteroids described with different axes}
Observers on planets A and B both see the two asteroids
colliding. The asteroids are of equal mass and their impact
speeds are the same. Astronomers on each planet decide to
define their own planet as the axis of rotation. Planet A is
twice as far from the collision as planet B. The asteroids
collide and stick. For simplicity, assume planets A and B
are both at rest.

With planet A as the axis, the two asteroids have the same
amount of angular momentum, but one has positive angular
momentum and the other has negative. Before the collision,
the total angular momentum is therefore zero. After the
collision, the two asteroids will have stopped moving, and
again the total angular momentum is zero. The total angular
momentum both before and after the collision is zero, so
angular momentum is conserved if you choose planet A as the
axis.

The only difference with planet B  as axis is that $r$ is
smaller by a factor of two, so all the angular momenta are
halved. Even though the angular momenta are different than
the ones calculated by planet A, angular momentum is still
conserved.
\end{eg}

The earth spins on its own axis once a day, but
simultaneously travels in its circular one-year orbit around
the sun, so any given part of it traces out a complicated
loopy path. It would seem difficult to calculate the earth's
angular momentum, but it turns out that there is an
intuitively appealing shortcut: we can simply add up the
angular momentum due to its spin plus that arising from its
center of mass's circular motion around the sun. This is a
special case of the following general theorem:

\mythmhdr{The spin theorem} An object's angular momentum
with respect to some outside axis A can be found by adding up
two parts:\\
(1) The first part is the object's angular momentum found by using
its own center of mass as the axis, i.e., the angular momentum the object
has because it is spinning.\\
(2) The other part equals the angular momentum that the object
would have with respect to the axis A if it had all its mass
concentrated at and moving with its center of mass.\index{spin theorem}

\begin{eg}{A system with its center of mass at rest}
In the special case of an object whose center of mass is at
rest, the spin theorem implies that the object's angular
momentum is the same regardless of what axis we choose.
(This is an even stronger statement than the choice of axis
theorem, which only guarantees that angular momentum is
conserved for any given choice of axis, without specifying
that it is the same for all such choices.)
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Angular momentum of a rigid object}
\egquestion
A motorcycle wheel has almost all its mass
concentrated at the outside. If the wheel has mass $m$ and
radius $r$, and the time required for one revolution is $T$,
what is the spin part of its angular momentum?

\eganswer
This is an example of the commonly encountered
special case of rigid motion, as opposed to the rotation of
a system like a hurricane in which the different parts take
different amounts of time to go around. We don't really have
to go through a laborious process of adding up contributions
from all the many parts of a wheel, because they are all at
about the same distance from the axis, and are all moving
around the axis at about the same speed. The velocity is all
perpendicular to the spokes,
\begin{align*}
         v_{\perp}        
                &=  (\zu{circumference})/ T \\
                &=   2\pi  r/ T
\end{align*}
and the angular momentum of the wheel about its center
is
\begin{align*}
         L        &=   mv_{\perp} r \\
                &=   m(2\pi  r/ T) r \\
                &=  2\pi  mr^2/ T\eqquad.
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

Note that although the factors of $2\pi$ in this expression is
peculiar to a wheel with its mass concentrated on the rim,
the proportionality to $m/T$ would have been the same for any
other rigidly rotating object. Although an object with a
noncircular shape does not have a radius, it is also true in
general that angular momentum is proportional to the square
of the object's size for fixed values of $m$ and $T$. For
instance doubling an object's size doubles both the
$v_{\perp}$ and $r$ factors in the contribution of each of its
parts to the total angular momentum, resulting in an overall
factor of four increase.

<% end_sec('ang-mom-theorems') %>

<% begin_sec("Torque",nil,'torque') %>

Force is the rate of transfer of
momentum. The corresponding quantity in the case of angular momentum is
called torque (rhymes with ``fork''). Where force tells us
how hard we are pushing or pulling on something, torque
indicates how hard we are twisting on it. Torque is
represented by the Greek letter tau, $\tau$, and the rate of
change of an object's angular momentum equals the total
torque acting on it,\index{torque!defined}
\begin{equation*}
        \tau_{total} = \der L/\der t\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

As with force and momentum, it often happens that angular
momentum recedes into the background and we focus our
interest on the torques. The torque-focused point of view is
exemplified by the fact that many scientifically untrained
but mechanically apt people know all about torque, but none
of them have heard of angular momentum. Car enthusiasts
eagerly compare engines' torques, and there is a tool called
a torque wrench which allows one to apply a desired amount
of torque to a screw and avoid overtightening it.

<% begin_sec("Torque distinguished from force",nil,'torque-vs-force') %>

Of course a force is necessary in order to create a torque ---
you can't twist a screw without pushing on the wrench --- but
force and torque are two different things. One distinction
between them is direction. We use positive and negative
signs to represent forces in the two possible directions
along a line. The direction of a torque, however, is
clockwise or counterclockwise, not a linear direction.

The other difference between torque and force is a matter of
leverage. A given force applied at a door's knob will change
the door's angular momentum twice as rapidly as the same
force applied halfway between the knob and the hinge. The
same amount of force produces different amounts of torque in
these two cases.

It's possible to have a zero total torque with a nonzero
total force. An airplane with four jet engines would be
designed so that their forces are balanced on the left and
right. Their forces are all in the same direction, but the
clockwise torques of two of the engines are canceled by the
counterclockwise torques of the other two, giving zero total
torque.

Conversely we can have zero total force and nonzero total
torque. A merry-go-round's engine needs to supply a nonzero
torque on it to bring it up to speed, but there is zero
total force on it. If there was not zero total force on it,
its center of mass would accelerate!

How do we calculate the amount of torque produced by a given
force? Since it depends on leverage, we should expect it to
depend on the distance between the axis and the point of
application of the force. I'll work out an equation relating
torque to force for a particular very simple situation, and
give a more rigorous derivation on page \pageref{eg:torqueproof},
after developing some mathematical techniques that dramatically
shorten and simplify the proof.

Consider a pointlike object which is initially at rest at a
distance $r$ from the axis we have chosen for defining angular
momentum. We first observe that a force directly inward or
outward, along the line connecting the axis to the object,
does not impart any angular momentum to the object.

A force perpendicular to the line connecting the axis and
the object does, however, make the object pick up angular
momentum. Newton's second law gives
\begin{equation*}
        a = F/m\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
and using $a=\der v/\der t$ we
find the velocity the object acquires after a time $\der t$,
\begin{equation*}
        \der v = F\der t/m\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We're trying to relate force to a change in angular
momentum, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $mr$ to
give
\begin{align*}
        m\der v\:r &= F\der t\:r  \\
        \der L &= F\der t\:r\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Dividing by $\der t$ gives the torque:
\begin{align*}
        \frac{\der L}{\der t}& = Fr \\
        \tau &= Fr\eqquad.
\end{align*}
If a force acts at an angle other than 0 or $90\degunit$ with respect
to the line joining the object and the axis, it would be
only the component of the force perpendicular to the line
that would produce a torque,
\begin{equation*}
        \tau = F_{\perp}r\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Although this result was proved under a simplified set of
circumstances, it is more generally valid:\footnote{A proof is given

\mythmhdr{Relationship between force and torque} The rate
at which a force transfers angular momentum to an object, i.e.,
the torque produced by the force, is given by
\begin{equation*}
        |\tau| = r |F_{\perp}|\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $r$ is the distance from the axis to the point of application
of the force, and $F_{\perp}$ is the component of the force that
is perpendicular to the line joining the axis to the point of
application.

The equation is stated with absolute value signs because the
positive and negative signs of force and torque indicate
different things, so there is no useful relationship between
them. The sign of the torque must be found by physical
inspection of the case at hand.

From the equation, we see that the units of torque can be
written as newtons multiplied by meters. Metric torque
wrenches are calibrated in $\nunit\unitdot\munit$, but American ones use
foot-pounds, which is also a unit of distance multiplied by
a unit of force. We know from our study of mechanical work
that newtons multiplied by meters equal joules, but torque
is a completely different quantity from work, and nobody
writes torques with units of joules, even though it would be
technically correct.

\begin{eg}{How torque depends on the direction of the force}
\egquestion
How can the torque applied to the wrench in the
figure be expressed in terms of $r$, $| F|$, and the angle $\theta$?

\eganswer
The force vector and its $F_{\perp}$ component form
the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle,\\

\anonymousinlinefig{../../../share/mechanics/figs/wrench-sin-theta}\\
and the interior angle opposite to $F_{\perp}$  equals $\theta$. The
absolute value of $F_{\perp}$  can thus be expressed
as
\begin{equation*}
         F_{\perp}  =  |\vc{F}|\ \zu{sin}\:\theta   ,
\end{equation*}
leading to
\begin{equation*}
        |\tau|  =   r |\vc{F}|\ \zu{sin}\:\theta\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
\end{eg}

Sometimes torque can be more neatly visualized in terms of
the quantity $r_{\perp}$ shown in the figure on the left, which gives
us a third way of expressing the relationship between torque
and force:
\begin{equation*}
        |\tau|  =  r_{\perp} |F|\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Of course you wouldn't want to go and memorize all three
equations for torque. Starting from any one of them you
could easily derive the other two using trigonometry.
Familiarizing yourself with them can however clue you in to
easier avenues of attack on certain problems.

Up until now we've been thinking in terms of a force that
acts at a single point on an object, such as the force of
your hand on the wrench. This is of course an approximation,
and for an extremely realistic calculation of your hand's
torque on the wrench you might need to add up the torques
exerted by each square millimeter where your skin touches
the wrench. This is seldom necessary. But in the case of a
gravitational force, there is never any single point at
which the force is applied. Our planet is exerting a
separate tug on every brick in the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
and the total gravitational torque on the tower is the sum
of the torques contributed by all the little forces. Luckily
there is a trick that allows us to avoid such a massive
calculation. It turns out that for purposes of computing the
total gravitational torque on an object, you can get the
right answer by just pretending that the whole gravitational
force acts at the object's center of mass.

Your arm has a mass of 3.0 kg, and its center of
mass is 30 cm from your shoulder. What is the gravitational
torque on your arm when it is stretched out horizontally to
one side, taking the shoulder to be the axis?

\eganswer
The total gravitational force acting on your arm
is
\begin{equation*}
        |\vc{F}| = ( 3.0\ \zu{kg})( 9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2) = 29\ \zu{N}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
For the purpose of calculating the gravitational torque, we
can treat the force as if it acted at the arm's center of
mass. The force is straight down, which is perpendicular to
the line connecting the shoulder to the center of mass,
so
\begin{equation*}
         F_{\perp} = |\vc{F}| = 29\ \nunit\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Continuing to pretend that the force acts at the center of
the arm, $r$ equals 30 cm = 0.30 m, so the torque is
\begin{equation*}
        \tau =  r\: F_{\perp} = 9\ \nunit\cdot\munit\eqquad.

In chapter \ref{ch:2} I defined
equilibrium as a situation where the interaction energy is minimized. This
is the same as a condition of zero total force, or constant momentum.
Thus a car is in equilibrium not just when it is parked but also when it
is cruising down a straight road with constant momentum.

Likewise there are many cases where a system is not closed but
maintains constant angular momentum. When a merry-go-round
is running at constant angular momentum, the engine's torque
is being canceled by the torque due to friction.  

It's not enough for a boat not to sink --- we'd also like to avoid having
it capsize. For this reason, we now redefine equilibrium as follows.

When an object has constant momentum and constant angular
momentum, we say that it is in equilibrium. Again, this is a
scientific redefinition of the common English word, since in
ordinary speech nobody would describe a car spinning out on
an icy road as being in equilibrium.\index{equilibrium!redefined}

Very commonly, however, we are interested in cases where an
object is not only in equilibrium but also at rest, and this
corresponds more closely to the usual meaning of the word.
Statics is the branch of physics concerned
with problems such as these.

Solving statics problems is now simply a matter of applying
and combining some things you already know:

- You know the behaviors of the various types of forces, for
example that a frictional force is always parallel to the
surface of contact.

- You know about vector addition of forces. It is the vector
sum of the forces that must equal zero to produce
equilibrium.

- You know about torque. The total torque acting on an
object must be zero if it is to be in equilibrium.

- You know that the choice of axis is arbitrary, so you can
make a choice of axis that makes the problem easy to solve.

In general, this type of problem could involve four
equations in four unknowns: three equations that say the
force components add up to zero, and one equation that says
the total torque is zero. Most cases you'll encounter will
not be this complicated. In the example below, only the
equation for zero total torque is required in order to get
an answer.

\begin{eg}{A flagpole}\label{eg:flagpole}
\egquestion
A 10-kg flagpole is being held up by a lightweight
horizontal cable, and is propped against the foot of a wall
as shown in the figure. If the cable is only capable of
supporting a tension of 70 N, how great can the angle $\alpha$ be
without breaking the cable?

\eganswer All three objects in the figure are supposed to be
in equilibrium: the pole, the cable, and the wall. Whichever
of the three objects we pick to investigate, all the forces
and torques on it have to cancel out. It is not particularly
helpful to analyze the forces and torques on the wall, since
it has forces on it from the ground that are not given and
that we don't want to find. We could study the forces and
torques on the cable, but that doesn't let us use the given
information about the pole. The object we need to analyze is the pole.

The pole has three forces on it, each of which may also
result in a torque: (1) the gravitational force, (2) the
cable's force, and (3) the wall's force.

We are free to define an axis of rotation at any point we
wish, and it is helpful to define it to lie at the bottom
end of the pole, since by that definition the wall's force
on the pole is applied at $r=0$ and thus makes no torque on
the pole. This is good, because we don't know what the
wall's force on the pole is, and we are not trying to find it.

With this choice of axis, there are two nonzero torques on
the pole, a counterclockwise torque from the cable and a
clockwise torque from gravity. Choosing to represent
counterclockwise torques as positive numbers, and using the equation
$|\btau| =r|F| \sin \theta$, we have
\begin{equation*}
                r_{cable} |F_{cable}| \sin   \theta_{cable} - r_{grav}|F_{grav}|\sin  \theta_{grav}  =  0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
A little geometry gives $\theta_{cable}=90\degunit-\alpha$ and $\theta_{grav}=\alpha$, so
\begin{equation*}
                r_{cable} |F_{cable}| \sin   (90\degunit-\alpha) - r_{grav}|F_{grav}| \sin   \alpha  =  0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The gravitational force can be considered as acting at the
pole's center of mass, i.e., at its geometrical center, so
$r_{cable}$ is twice $r_{grav}$, and we can simplify
the equation to read
\begin{equation*}
                2 |F_{cable}| \sin   (90\degunit-\alpha) - |F_{grav}| \sin   \alpha =  0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
These are all quantities we were given, except for $\alpha$,
which is the angle we want to find. To solve for $\alpha$
we need to use the trig identity
$\sin (90\degunit-x)= \cos x$,
\begin{equation*}
                2 |F_{cable}| \cos  \alpha - |F_{grav}| \sin   \alpha  =  0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which allows us to find
\begin{align*}
 \tan\alpha  &= 2\frac{|\vc{F}_{cable}|}{|\vc{F}_{grav}|}\\
 \alpha &= \tan^{-1}\left(2\frac{|\vc{F}_{cable}|}{|\vc{F}_{grav}|}\right)\\
        &= \tan^{-1}\left(2\times\frac{70\ \nunit}{98\ \nunit}\right)\\
        &= 55\degunit\eqquad.

__incl(eg/modern-art)

Why is one equilibrium stable and another unstable? Try
pushing your own nose to the left or the right. If you push
it a millimeter to the left, it responds with a gentle force
to the right. If you push it a centimeter to the left, its
force on your finger becomes much stronger. The defining
characteristic of a stable equilibrium is that the farther
the object is moved away from equilibrium, the stronger the
force is that tries to bring it back.

The opposite is true for an unstable equilibrium. In the top
figure, the ball resting on the round hill theoretically has
zero total force on it when it is exactly at the top. But in
reality the total force will not be exactly zero, and the
ball will begin to move off to one side. Once it has moved,
the net force on the ball is greater than it was, and it
accelerates more rapidly. In an unstable equilibrium, the
farther the object gets from equilibrium, the stronger the
force that pushes it farther from equilibrium.

This idea can be rephrased in terms of energy. The difference
between the stable and unstable equilibria shown in figure
\figref{stable-and-unstable} is that in the stable
equilibrium, the energy is at a minimum, and moving
to either side of equilibrium will increase it, whereas
the unstable equilibrium represents a maximum.

Note that we are using the term ``stable'' in a weaker sense
than in ordinary speech. A domino standing upright is stable
in the sense we are using, since it will not spontaneously
fall over in response to a sneeze from across the room or
the vibration from a passing truck. We would only call it
unstable in the technical sense if it could be toppled by
\emph{any} force, no matter how small. In everyday usage, of
course, it would be considered unstable, since the force
required to topple it is so small.

\eganswer The equilibrium points occur where the U is at a minimum
or maximum, and minima and maxima occur where the derivative (which equals
minus the force on Nancy) is zero.
This derivative is $\der U/\der x=4x^3-2x$, and setting it equal to
zero, we have $x=0, \pm1/\sqrt{2}$. Minima occur where the second derivative
is positive, and maxima where it is negative. The second derivative is
$12x^2-2$, which is negative at $x=0$ (unstable)
and positive at $x=\pm1/\sqrt{2}$ (stable).

<% begin_sec("Proof of Kepler's elliptical orbit law",nil,'elliptical-orbit-proof') %>

Kepler determined purely empirically that the planets'
orbits were ellipses, without understanding the underlying
reason in terms of physical law. Newton's proof of this fact
based on his laws of motion and law of gravity was
considered his crowning achievement both by him and by his
contemporaries, because it showed that the same physical
laws could be used to analyze both the heavens and the
earth. Newton's proof was very lengthy, but by applying the
more recent concepts of conservation of energy and angular
momentum we can carry out the proof quite simply and
succinctly. This subsection can be skipped without losing the
continuity of the text.

The basic idea of the proof is that we want to describe the
shape of the planet's orbit with an equation, and then show
that this equation is exactly the one that represents an
ellipse. Newton's original proof had to be very complicated
because it was based directly on his laws of motion, which
include time as a variable. To make any statement about the
shape of the orbit, he had to eliminate time from his
equations, leaving only space variables. But conservation
laws tell us that certain things don't change over time, so
they have already had time eliminated from them.

There are many ways of representing a curve by an equation,
of which the most familiar is $y=ax+b$ for a line in two
dimensions. It would be perfectly possible to describe a
planet's orbit using an $x$-$y$ equation like this, but remember
that we are applying conservation of angular momentum, and
the space variables that occur in the equation for angular
momentum are the distance from the axis, $r$, and the angle
between the velocity vector and the $r$ vector, which we will
call $\varphi$. The planet will have $\varphi=90\degunit$ when it is moving
perpendicular to the $r$ vector, i.e., at the moments when it
is at its smallest or greatest distances from the sun. When
$\varphi$ is less than $90\degunit$ the planet is approaching the sun, and
when it is greater than $90\degunit$ it is receding from it.
Describing a curve with an $r$-$\varphi$ equation is like telling a
driver in a parking lot a certain rule for what direction to
steer based on the distance from a certain streetlight in
the middle of the lot.

The proof is broken into the three parts for easier
digestion. The first part is a simple and intuitively
reasonable geometrical fact about ellipses, whose proof we
relegate to the caption of figure \figref{proof-b}; you will not be missing
much if you merely absorb the result without reading the
proof.

(1) If we use one of the two foci of an ellipse as an axis
for defining the variables $r$ and $\varphi$, then the angle between
the tangent line and the line drawn to the other focus is
the same as $\varphi$, i.e., the two angles labeled $\varphi$ in the figure
are in fact equal.

The other two parts form the meat of our proof. We state the
results first and then prove them.

(2) A planet, moving under the influence of the sun's
gravity with less than the energy required to escape, obeys
an equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
   \sin\:\varphi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-pr^2+qr}}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $p$ and $q$ are positive constants that depend on the planet's
energy and angular momentum and $p$ is greater than zero.

(3) A curve is an ellipse if and only if its $r$-$\varphi$ equation is
of the form
\begin{equation*}
   \sin\:\varphi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-pr^2+qr}}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $p$ and $q$ are positive constants that depend on the size and
shape of the ellipse.

<% begin_sec("Proof of part (2)",nil,'elliptical-orbit-proof-lemma') %>

The component of the planet's velocity vector that is
perpendicular to the \vc{r} vector is $v_\perp=v \sin\varphi$, so conservation
of angular momentum tells us that $L = mrv \sin \varphi$ is a
constant. Since the planet's mass is a constant, this is the
same as the condition
\begin{equation*}
        rv \sin \varphi = \text{constant}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Conservation of energy gives
\begin{equation*}
         \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - G\frac{Mm}{r}= \text{constant}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

We solve the first equation for $v$ and plug into the second
equation to eliminate $v$. Straightforward algebra then leads
to the equation claimed above, with the constant $p$ being
positive because of our assumption that the planet's energy
is insufficient to escape from the sun, i.e., its total
energy is negative.

(180\degunit-x)=-\cos x$ and $\cos 2x = 1-2\:\sin^2\:x$, we can rewrite this
as
\begin{equation*}
        d^2 = r^2 + s^2 - 2rs\left(2\sin^2\varphi-1\right)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Straightforward algebra transforms this into
\begin{equation*}
         \sin\:\varphi = \sqrt{\frac{(r+s)^2-d^2}{4rs}}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Since $r+s$ is constant, the top of the fraction is constant,
and the denominator can be rewritten as $4rs=4r(\text{constant}-r)$,
which is equivalent to the desired form.

In each case, calculate the total torque on the ruler, and find out
whether it equals zero to roughly within the accuracy of the experiment.
