\epigraph{Madam, what good is a baby?}%
{Michael Faraday, when asked by Queen Victoria what the
electrical devices in his lab were good for}\index{Faraday, Michael}

A few years ago, my wife and I bought a house with
Character, Character being a survival mechanism that houses
have evolved in order to convince humans to agree to much
larger mortgage payments than they'd originally envisioned.
Anyway, one of the features that gives our house Character
is that it possesses, built into the wall of the family
room, a set of three pachinko machines. These are Japanese
gambling devices sort of like vertical pinball machines.
(The legal papers we got from the sellers hastened to tell
us that they were ``for amusement purposes only.'')
Unfortunately, only one of the three machines was working
when we moved in, and it soon died on us. Having become a
pachinko addict, I decided to fix it, but that was easier
said than done. The inside is a veritable Rube Goldberg
mechanism of levers, hooks, springs, and chutes. My hormonal
pride, combined with my Ph.D. in physics, made me certain of
success, and rendered my eventual utter failure all
the more demoralizing.

Contemplating my defeat, I realized how few complex
mechanical devices I used from day to day. Apart from our
cars and my saxophone, every technological tool in our
modern life-support system was electronic rather than mechanical.

We are surrounded by things we have been \emph{told} are
``electrical,'' but it's far from obvious what they have in
common to justify being grouped together. What relationship
is there between the way socks cling together and the way a
battery lights a lightbulb? We have been told that both an
electric eel and our own brains are somehow electrical in
nature, but what do they have in common?

British physicist Michael \index{Faraday, Michael!types of
electricity}Faraday (1791-1867) set out to address this
problem. He investigated electricity from a variety of
sources --- including electric eels! --- to see whether they
could all produce the same effects, such as shocks and
sparks, attraction and repulsion. ``Heating'' refers, for
example, to the way a lightbulb filament gets hot enough to
glow and emit light. Magnetic induction is an effect
discovered by Faraday himself that connects electricity and
magnetism. We will not study this effect, which is the basis
for the electric generator, in detail until later in the book.

The table shows a summary of some of Faraday's results.
Check marks indicate that Faraday or his close contemporaries
were able to verify that a particular source of electricity
was capable of producing a certain effect. (They evidently
failed to demonstrate attraction and repulsion between
objects charged by electric eels, although modern workers
have studied these species in detail and been able to
understand all their electrical characteristics on the same
footing as other forms of electricity.)

Faraday's results indicate that there is nothing fundamentally
different about the types of electricity supplied by the
various sources. They are all able to produce a wide variety
of identical effects. Wrote Faraday, ``The general
conclusion which must be drawn from this collection of facts
is that electricity, whatever may be its source, is
identical in its nature.''

If  the types of electricity are the same thing, what thing
is that? The answer is provided by the fact that all the
sources of electricity can cause objects to repel or attract
each other. We use the word ``charge'' to describe the
property of an object that allows it to participate in such
electrical forces, and we have learned that charge is
present in matter in the form of nuclei and electrons.
Evidently all these electrical phenomena boil down to the
motion of charged particles in matter.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Electric current") %>

\enlargethispage{-3\baselineskip}

 If the fundamental phenomenon is the motion of charged
particles, then how can we define a useful numerical
measurement of it? We might describe the flow of a river
simply by the velocity of the water, but velocity will not
be appropriate for electrical purposes because we need to
take into account how much charge the moving particles have,
and in any case there are no practical devices sold at Radio
Shack that can tell us the velocity of charged particles.
Experiments show that the intensity of various electrical
effects is related to a different quantity: the number of
coulombs of charge that pass by a certain point per second.
By analogy with the flow of water, this quantity is called
the \index{electric current!defined}electric \emph{current}
\index{current!defined}, $I$.
Its units of coulombs/second are more conveniently
abbreviated as \index{ampere (unit)}amperes, 1 A=1 C/s.
(In informal speech, one usually says ``amps.'')

The main subtlety involved in this definition is how to
account for the two types of charge. The stream of water
coming from a hose is made of atoms containing charged
particles, but it produces none of the effects we associate
with electric currents. For example, you do not get an
electrical shock when you are sprayed by a hose. This type
of experiment shows that the effect created by the motion of
one type of charged particle can be canceled out by the
motion of the opposite type of charge in the same direction.
In water, every oxygen atom with a charge of $+8e$ is
surrounded by eight electrons with charges of $-e$, and
likewise for the hydrogen atoms.  

\enlargethispage{-3\baselineskip}

We therefore refine our definition of current as follows:

When charged particles are exchanged between regions of space
A and B, the electric current flowing from A to B is defined as
\begin{equation*}
        I = \frac{\der q}{\der t}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $\der q$ is the change in region B's total charge occurring over
a period of time $\der t$.

In the garden hose example, your body picks up equal amounts
of positive and negative charge, resulting in no change in
your total charge, so the electrical current flowing into you is zero.

\begin{eg}{Ions moving across a cell membrane}\label{eg:cells}
\egquestion
Figure \figref{cells} shows ions, labeled with their charges,
moving in or out through the membranes of four cells. If
the ions all cross the membranes during the same interval of
time, how would the currents into the cells compare with each other?

\eganswer
We're just assuming the rate of flow is constant, so we can talk about
$\Delta  q$ instead of $\der q$.

Cell A has positive current going into it because its
charge is increased, i.e., has a positive value of $\Delta  q$.

Cell B has the same current as cell A, because by losing
one unit of negative charge it also ends up increasing its
own total charge by one unit.

        Cell C's total charge is reduced by three units, so it has
a large negative current going into it.

        Cell D loses one unit of charge, so it has a small
negative current into it.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Finding current given charge}
\egquestion
A charged balloon falls to the ground, and its
charge begins leaking off to the Earth. Suppose that the
charge on the balloon is given by $q=ae^{-bt}$. Find
the current as a function of time, and interpret the answer.

\eganswer
        Taking the derivative, we have
\begin{align*}
                 I         &=    \frac{\der  q}{\der  t}  \\
                         &=      - abe^{- bt}
\end{align*}
An  exponential function approaches zero as the exponent
gets more and more negative. This means that both the charge
and the current are decreasing in magnitude with time. It
makes sense that the charge approaches zero, since the
balloon is losing its charge. It also makes sense that the
current is decreasing in magnitude, since charge cannot flow
at the same rate forever without overshooting zero.

\end{eg}

The reverse of differentiation is integration, so if we know the current
as a function of time, we can find the charge by integrating.
Example \ref{eg:atlas} on page \pageref{eg:atlas} shows such
a calculation.

It may seem strange to say that a negatively charged
particle going one way creates a current going the other
way, but this is quite ordinary. As we will see, currents
flow through metal wires via the motion of electrons, which
are negatively charged, so the direction of motion of the
electrons in a circuit is always opposite to the direction
of the current. Of course it would have been convenient of
Benjamin Franklin had defined the positive and negative
signs of charge the opposite way, since so many electrical
devices are based on metal wires.

\begin{eg}{Number of electrons flowing through a lightbulb}
\egquestion
If a lightbulb has 1.0 A flowing through it, how
many electrons will pass through the filament in 1.0 s?

\eganswer
        We are only calculating the number of electrons
that flow, so we can ignore the positive and negative signs. Also,
since the rate of flow is constant, we don't really need to think in terms
of calculus; the derivative $\der q/\der t$ that defines current is
the same as $\Delta q/\Delta t$ in this situation.
Solving for
$\Delta q= I \Delta  t$ gives a charge of 1.0 C flowing in
this time interval. The number of electrons is
\begin{align*}
        \text{number of electrons}         &=         \text{coulombs}\times\frac{\text{electrons}}{\text{coulomb}}  \\
                 &=         \text{coulombs}/\frac{\text{coulombs}}{\text{electron}}   \\
                 &=          1.0\ \zu{C} /  e  \\
                 &=          6.2\times10^{18}   
\end{align*}

\end{eg}

<% begin_sec("Circuits") %>

How can we put electric currents to work? The only method of
controlling electric charge we have studied so far is to
charge different substances, e.g., rubber and fur, by rubbing
them against each other. Figure \figref{basiccircuits}/1 shows an attempt to use
this technique to light a lightbulb. This method is
unsatisfactory. True, current will flow through the bulb,
since electrons can move through metal wires, and the excess
electrons on the rubber rod will therefore come through the
wires and bulb due to the attraction of the positively
charged fur and the repulsion of the other electrons. The
problem is that after a zillionth of a second of current,
the rod and fur will both have run out of charge. No more
current will flow, and the lightbulb will go out.

Figure \figref{basiccircuits}/2 shows a setup that works. The battery pushes
charge through the circuit, and recycles it over and over
again. (We will have more to say later in this chapter about
how batteries work.) This is called a \emph{\index{circuit!complete}\index{complete
circuit}complete \index{circuit}circuit}. Today, the
electrical use of the word ``circuit'' is the only one that
springs to mind for most people, but the original meaning
was to travel around and make a round trip, as when a
circuit court judge would ride around the boondocks,
dispensing justice in each town on a certain date.

    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Note that an example like \figref{basiccircuits}/3 does not work. The wire will
quickly begin acquiring a net charge, because it has no way
to get rid of the charge flowing into it. The repulsion of
this charge will make it more and more difficult to send any
more charge in, and soon the electrical forces exerted by
the battery will be canceled out completely. The whole
process would be over so quickly that the filament would not
even have enough time to get hot and glow. This is known as
an \index{circuit!open}\index{open circuit}\emph{open circuit}.
Exactly the same thing would happen if the complete circuit
of figure \figref{basiccircuits}/2 was cut somewhere with a pair of scissors, and
in fact that is essentially how an ordinary light switch
works: by opening up a gap in the circuit.

The definition of electric current we have developed has the
great virtue that it is easy to measure. In practical
electrical work, one almost always measures current, not
charge. The instrument used to measure current is called an
\index{ammeter}\emph{ammeter}.
A simplified ammeter, \figref{basiccircuits}/4, simply
consists of a coiled-wire magnet whose force twists an iron
needle against the resistance of a spring. The greater the
current, the greater the force. Although the construction of
ammeters may differ, their use is always the same. We break
into the path of the electric current and interpose the
meter like a tollbooth on a road, \figref{basiccircuits}/5. There is still a
complete circuit, and as far as the battery and bulb are
concerned, the ammeter is just another segment of wire.

Does it matter where in the circuit we place the ammeter?
Could we, for instance, have put it in the left side of the
circuit instead of the right? Conservation of charge tells
us that this can make no difference. Charge is not destroyed
or ``used up'' by the lightbulb, so we will get the same
current reading on either side of it. What is ``used up'' is
energy stored in the battery, which is being converted into
heat and light energy.

 % ---------------------------------------------- 

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Voltage") %>

<% begin_sec("The volt unit") %>

Electrical circuits can be used for sending signals, storing
information, or doing calculations, but their most common
purpose by far is to manipulate energy, as in the battery-and-bulb
example of the previous section. We know that lightbulbs are
rated in units of watts, i.e., how many joules per second of
energy they can convert into heat and light, but how would
this relate to the flow of charge as measured in amperes? By
way of analogy, suppose your friend, who didn't take
physics, can't find any job better than pitching bales of
hay. The number of calories he burns per hour will certainly
depend on how many bales he pitches per minute, but it will
also be proportional to how much mechanical work he has to
do on each bale. If his job is to toss them up into a
hayloft, he will get tired a lot more quickly than someone
who merely tips bales off a loading dock into trucks. In metric units,
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{second}}
         = \frac{\text{haybales}}{\text{second}}
                 \times \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{haybale}}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
Similarly, the rate of energy transformation by a battery
will not just depend on how many coulombs per second it
pushes through a circuit but also on how much mechanical
work it has to do on each coulomb of charge:
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{second}}
         = \frac{\text{coulombs}}{\text{second}}
                 \times \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{coulomb}}
\end{equation*}
\noindent or
\begin{equation*}
                \text{power}         =         \text{current} \times \text{work per unit charge}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}

Units of joules per coulomb are abbreviated as \index{volt
(unit)!defined}\emph{volts}, 1 V=1 J/C, named after the Italian
physicist Alessandro Volta. Everyone knows that batteries are
rated in units of volts, but the voltage concept is more
general than that; it turns out that voltage is a property
of every point in space. To gain more insight, let's think
more carefully about what goes on in the battery and bulb circuit.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("The concept of voltage (electrical potential) in general") %>
\label{subsubsec:voltage}

To do work on a charged particle, the battery apparently
must be exerting forces on it. How does it do this? Well,
the only thing that can exert an electrical force on a
charged particle is another charged particle. It's as though
the haybales were pushing and pulling each other into the
hayloft! This is potentially a horribly complicated
situation. Even if we knew how much excess positive or
negative charge there was at every point in the circuit
(which realistically we don't) we would have to calculate
zillions of forces using Coulomb's law,  perform all the
vector additions, and finally calculate how much work was
being done on the charges as they moved along. To make
things even more scary, there is more than one type of
charged particle that moves: electrons are what move in the
wires and the bulb's filament, but ions are the moving
charge carriers inside the battery. Luckily, there are two
ways in which we can simplify things:

\begin{indentedblock}
        \noindent\textbf{The situation is unchanging.} Unlike the imaginary setup in
        which we attempted to light a bulb using a rubber rod and a
        piece of fur, this circuit maintains itself in a steady
        state (after perhaps a microsecond-long period of settling
        down after the circuit is first assembled). The current is
        steady, and as charge flows out of any area of the circuit
        it is replaced by the same amount of charge flowing in. The
        amount of excess positive or negative charge in any part of
        the circuit therefore stays constant. Similarly, when we
        watch a river flowing, the water goes by but the river doesn't disappear.

        \noindent\textbf{Force depends only on position.} Since the charge distribution
        is not changing, the total electrical force on a charged
        particle depends only on its own charge and on its location.
        If another charged particle of the same type visits the same
        location later on, it will feel exactly the same force.
\end{indentedblock}

The second observation tells us that there is nothing all
that different about the experience of one charged particle
as compared to another's. If we single out one particle to
pay attention to, and figure out the amount of work done on
it by electrical forces as it goes from point A to point B
along a certain path, then this is the same amount of work
that will be done on any other charged particles of the same
type as it follows the same path. For the sake of visualization,
let's think about the path that starts at one terminal of
the battery, goes through the light bulb's filament, and
ends at the other terminal. When an object experiences a
force that depends only on its position (and when certain
other, technical conditions are satisfied), we can define an
electrical energy associated with the position of that
object. The amount of work done on the particle by
electrical forces as it moves from A to B equals the drop
in electrical energy between A and B. This
electrical energy is what is being converted into other forms
of energy such as heat and light. We therefore define
$\Delta V$ in general as electrical energy per unit charge:

The $\Delta V$ between two points in space is defined as\index{voltage!defined}
\begin{equation*}
        \Delta V=\Delta U_{elec}/q\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta U_{elec}$ is the change in the electrical
energy of a particle with charge $q$ as it moves from the
initial point to the final point.
In this context, where we think of the voltage as being a scalar function that is
defined everywhere in space, it is more common in formal writing to refer to
it as the electrical \emph{potential}.\index{potential!electrical}

The amount of power dissipated (i.e., rate at which energy is
transformed by the flow of electricity) is then given by the equation
\begin{equation*}
                        P    =    I \Delta V\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}\index{power!electrical}

\begin{eg}{Energy stored in a battery}\label{eg:milliamp-hours}
\egquestion
The 1.2 V rechargeable battery in figure \figref{battery} is labeled 1800 milliamp-hours.
What is the maximum amount of energy the battery can store?

\eganswer
        An ampere-hour is a unit of current multiplied by
a unit of time. Current is charge per unit time, so an
ampere-hour is in fact a funny unit of \emph{charge}:
\begin{align*}
                \text{(1 A)(1 hour)}         &=    \text{(1 C/s)(3600 s)}  \\
                                 &=    \text{3600 C}  
\end{align*}
\noindent 1800 milliamp-hours is therefore $1800\times10^{-3}\times 3600\ \zu{C}=6.5\times10^3\ \zu{C}$.
That's a huge number of charged particles, but the
total loss of electrical energy will just be their total
charge multiplied by the voltage difference across which they move:
\begin{align*}
                \Delta  U_{elec}                 &=     q \Delta  V  \\
                                 &=    (6.5\times10^3\ \zu{C})(1.2\ \zu{V})  \\
                                 &=    7.8\ \zu{kJ}  
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Units of volt-amps}
\egquestion
Doorbells are often rated in volt-amps. What does
this combination of units mean?

\eganswer
        Current times voltage gives units of power,
$P= I\Delta  V$, so volt-amps are really just a nonstandard
way of writing watts. They are telling you how much power
the doorbell requires.

\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{Power dissipated by a battery and bulb}
\egquestion
If a 9.0-volt battery causes 1.0 A to flow through
a lightbulb, how much power is dissipated?

\eganswer
        The voltage rating of a battery tells us what
voltage difference $\Delta  V$ it is designed to maintain
between its terminals.
\begin{align*}
                 P         &=      I \ \Delta \zu{V}   \\
                         &=     9.0 \ \zu{A}\cdot\zu{V} \\
                         &=     9.0  \ \frac{\zu{C}}{\zu{s}}\cdot\frac{\zu{J}}{\zu{C}} \\
                         &=     9.0 \ \text{J/s}  \\
                         &=     9.0 \ \zu{W}  
\end{align*}

The only nontrivial thing in this problem was dealing with
the units. One quickly gets used to translating common
combinations like $\zu{A}\cdot\zu{V}$ into simpler terms.

\pagebreak[4]

Here are a few questions and answers about the voltage concept.

\noindent{}\emph{Question:\/} 
OK, so what \emph{is} voltage, really?\\
\noindent{}\emph{Answer:\/}  A device like a battery has positive and negative
charges inside it that push other charges around the outside
circuit. A higher-voltage battery has denser charges in it,
which will do more work on each charged particle that moves
through the outside circuit.

        To use a gravitational analogy, we can put a paddlewheel at
the bottom of either a tall waterfall or a short one, but a
kg of water that falls through the greater gravitational
energy difference will have more energy to give up
to the paddlewheel at the bottom.

\noindent{}\emph{Question:\/}  Why do we define voltage as electrical 
energy divided by charge, instead of just defining it as
electrical  energy?\\
\noindent{}\emph{Answer:\/}  One answer is that it's the only definition that
makes the equation $P=I \Delta V$  work. A more general
answer is that we want to be able to define a voltage
difference between any two points in space without having to
know in advance how much charge the particles moving between
them will have. If you put a nine-volt battery on your
tongue, then the charged particles that move across your
tongue and give you that tingly sensation are not electrons
but ions, which may have charges of $+e$, $-2e$, or
practically anything. The manufacturer probably expected the
battery to be used mostly in circuits with metal wires,
where the charged particles that flowed would be electrons
with charges of $-e$. If the ones flowing across your tongue
happen to have charges of $-2e$, the electrical energy
difference for them will be twice as much, but dividing by
their charge of $-2e$ in the definition of voltage will
still give a result of 9 $V$.

\noindent{}\emph{Question:\/}  Are there two separate roles for the charged
particles in the circuit, a type that sits still and exerts
the forces, and another that moves under the influence of those forces?\\
\noindent{}\emph{Answer:\/}  No. Every charged particle simultaneously plays both
roles. Newton's third law says that any particle that has an
electrical force acting on it must also be exerting an
electrical force back on the other particle. There are no
``designated movers'' or ``designated force-makers.''

\noindent{}\emph{Question:\/}  Why does the definition of voltage only refer to
voltage \emph{differences}?\\
\noindent{}\emph{Answer:\/}  It's perfectly OK to define voltage as $V=U_{elec}/q$.
But recall that it is only \emph{differences} in interaction
energy, $U$, that have direct physical meaning in physics.
Similarly, voltage differences are really more useful than
absolute voltages. A voltmeter measures voltage differences,
not absolute voltages.

So far we have simply presented it as an observed fact that
a battery-and-bulb circuit quickly settles down to a steady
flow, but why should it? Newton's second law, $a=F/m$, would
seem to predict that the steady forces on the charged
particles should make them whip around the circuit faster
and faster. The answer is that as charged particles move
through matter, there are always forces, analogous to
frictional forces, that resist the motion. These forces need
to be included in Newton's second law, which is really 
$a=F_{total}/m$, not  $a=F/m$.  If, by analogy, you push a
crate across the floor at constant speed, i.e., with zero
acceleration, the total force on it must be zero. After you
get the crate going, the floor's frictional force is exactly
canceling out your force. The chemical energy stored in your
body is being transformed into heat in the crate and the
floor, and no longer into an increase in the crate's kinetic
energy. Similarly, the battery's internal chemical energy is
converted into heat, not into perpetually increasing the
charged particles' kinetic energy. Changing energy into heat
may be a nuisance in some circuits, such as a computer chip,
but it is vital in an incandescent lightbulb, which must get hot enough to
glow. Whether we like it or not, this kind of heating effect
is going to occur any time charged particles move through matter.

What determines the amount of heating? One flashlight bulb
designed to work with a 9-volt battery might be labeled 1.0
watts, another 5.0. How does this work? Even without knowing
the details of this type of friction at the atomic level, we
can relate the heat dissipation to the amount of current
that flows via the equation $P=I\Delta $V. If the two
flashlight bulbs can have two different values of $P$ when
used with a battery that maintains the same $\Delta V$, it
must be that the 5.0-watt bulb allows five times more
current to flow through it.

For many substances, including the tungsten from which
lightbulb filaments are made, experiments show that the
amount of current that will flow through it is directly
proportional to the voltage difference placed across it. For
an object made of such a substance, we define its electrical
\index{resistance!defined}\emph{resistance} as follows:

<% marg(15) %>
<%
  fig(
    'ohm',
    %q{Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854).}

%>
<% end_marg %>

If an object inserted in a circuit displays a current flow which is
proportional to the voltage difference across it, then we define
its resistance as the constant ratio
\begin{equation*}
        R = \Delta V / I\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

\noindent The units of resistance are volts/ampere, usually abbreviated
as ohms, symbolized with the capital Greek letter omega, $\Omega$.

\begin{eg}{Resistance of a lightbulb}
\egquestion
A flashlight bulb powered by a 9-volt battery has
a resistance of 10 $\Omega$. How much current will it draw?

\eganswer
        Solving the definition of resistance for $I$, we find
\begin{align*}
                 I         &=    \Delta V/ R  \\
                         &=     0.9\ \zu{V}/\Omega   \\
                         &=     0.9\ \zu{V}/(\zu{V}/\zu{A})  \\
                         &=    \text{0.9 A}  
\end{align*}

\end{eg}

Ohm's law\index{Ohm's law}
states that many substances, including many solids
and some liquids, display this kind of behavior, at least
for voltages that are not too large. The fact that Ohm's law
is called a ``law'' should not be taken to mean that all
materials obey it, or that it has the same fundamental
importance as Newton's laws, for example. Materials are
called \index{ohmic!defined}\emph{ohmic} or \emph{nonohmic},
depending on whether they obey Ohm's law.

If objects of the same size and shape made from two
different ohmic materials have different resistances, we can
say that one material is more resistive than the other, or
equivalently that it is less conductive. Materials, such as
metals, that are very conductive are said to be good
\index{conductor!defined}\emph{conductors}. Those that are
extremely poor conductors, for example wood or rubber, are
classified as \index{insulator!defined}\emph{insulators}. There
is no sharp distinction between the two classes of
materials. Some, such as silicon, lie midway between the two
extremes, and are called semiconductors.

On an intuitive level, we can understand the idea of
resistance by making the sounds ``hhhhhh'' and ``ffffff.''
To make air flow out of your mouth, you use your diaphragm
to compress the air in your chest. The pressure difference
between your chest and the air outside your mouth is
analogous to a voltage difference. When you make the ``h''
sound, you form your mouth and throat in a way that allows
air to flow easily. The large flow of air is like a large
current. Dividing by a large current in the definition of
resistance means that we get a small resistance. We say that
the small resistance of your mouth and throat allows a large
current to flow. When you make the ``f'' sound, you increase
the resistance and cause a smaller current to flow.

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

Note that although the resistance of an object depends on
the substance it is made of, we cannot speak simply of the
``resistance of gold'' or the ``resistance of wood.'' 
Figure \figref{resistance-depends-on-shape} shows four examples of objects that have had wires
attached at the ends as electrical connections. If they were
made of the same substance, they would all nevertheless have
different resistances because of their different sizes and
shapes. A more detailed discussion will be more natural in
the context of the following chapter, but it should not be
too surprising that the resistance of \figref{resistance-depends-on-shape}/2 will be greater
than that of \figref{resistance-depends-on-shape}/1 --- the image of water flowing through a
pipe, however incorrect, gives us the right intuition.
Object \figref{resistance-depends-on-shape}/3 will have a smaller 
resistance than \figref{resistance-depends-on-shape}/1 because
the charged particles have less of it to get through.

<% begin_sec("Superconductors") %>

All materials display some variation in resistance according
to temperature (a fact that is used in thermostats to make a
thermometer that can be easily interfaced to an electric
circuit). More spectacularly, most metals have been found to
exhibit a sudden change to \emph{zero} resistance when
cooled to a certain critical temperature. They are then said
to be superconductors. Theoretically, superconductors should
make a great many exciting devices possible, for example
coiled-wire magnets that could be used to levitate trains.
In practice, the critical temperatures of all metals are
very low, and the resulting need for extreme refrigeration
has made their use uneconomical except for such specialized
applications as particle accelerators for physics research.

But scientists have recently made the surprising discovery
that certain ceramics are superconductors at less extreme
temperatures. The technological barrier is now in finding
practical methods for making wire out of these brittle
materials. Wall Street is currently investing billions of
dollars in developing superconducting devices for cellular
phone relay stations based on these materials. In 2001, the
city of Copenhagen replaced a short section of its
electrical power trunks with superconducing cables, and they
are now in operation and supplying power to customers.  

There is currently no satisfactory theory of superconductivity
in general, although superconductivity in metals is
understood fairly well. Unfortunately I have yet to find a
fundamental explanation of superconductivity in metals that
works at the introductory level.

\begin{eg}{Finding charge given current}\label{eg:atlas}
        \egquestion
        In the segment of the ATLAS accelerator shown in figure \figref{atlassegment},
        the current flowing back and forth
        between the two cylinders is given by $I= a \cos  bt$.
        What is the charge on one of the cylinders as a function of time?
\eganswer
                We are given the current and want to find the
        charge, i.e., we are given the derivative and we want to find
        the original function that would give that derivative. This
        means we need to integrate:
        \begin{align*}
                         q         &=   \int  I \der t  \\
                                 &=    \int  a \cos  bt \der t  \\
                                 &=    \frac{ a}{ b}\sin  bt+ q_\zu{o}\eqquad,  
        \end{align*}
        where $q_\zu{o}$ is a constant of integration.

We can interpret this in order to explain why a
superconductor needs to be used. The constant $b$ must be
very large, since the current is supposed to oscillate back
and forth millions of times a second. Looking at the final
result, we see that if $b$ is a very large number, and $q$
is to be a significant amount of charge, then $a$ must be a
very large number as well. If $a$ is numerically large, then
the current must be very large, so it would heat the
accelerator too much if it was flowing through an ordinary conductor.

The idea of a superconductor leads us to the question of how
we should expect an object to behave if it is made of a very
good conductor. Superconductors are an extreme case, but
often a metal wire can be thought of as a perfect conductor,
for example if the parts of the circuit other than the wire
are made of much less conductive materials. What happens if
$R$ equals zero in the equation $R=\Delta V/I$? The result
of dividing two numbers can only be zero if the number on
top equals zero. This tells us that if we pick any two
points in a perfect conductor, the voltage difference
between them must be zero. In other words, the entire
conductor must be at the same potential.

Constant potential means that no work would be done on a
charge as it moved from one point in the conductor to
another. If zero work was done only along a certain path
between two specific points, it might mean that positive
work was done along part of the path and negative work along
the rest, resulting in a cancellation. But there is no way
that the work could come out to be zero for all possible
paths unless the electrical force on a charge was in fact
zero at every point. Suppose, for example, that you build up
a static charge by scuffing your feet on a carpet, and then
you deposit some of that charge onto a doorknob, which is a
good conductor. How can all that charge be in the doorknob
without creating any electrical force at any point inside
it? The only possible answer is that the charge moves around
until it has spread itself into just the right configuration
so that the forces exerted by all the little bits of excess
surface charge on any charged particle within the doorknob
exactly cancel out.

We can explain this behavior if we assume that the charge
placed on the doorknob eventually settles down into a stable
equilibrium. Since the doorknob is a conductor, the charge
is free to move through it. If it was free to move and any
part of it did experience a nonzero total force from the
rest of the charge, then it would move, and we would not
have an equilibrium.

Excess charge placed on a conductor, once it
reaches its equilibrium configuration, is entirely on the
surface, not on the interior. This should be intuitively reasonable
in figure \figref{doorknob}, for example, since the charges are all
repelling each other. A proof is given in example \ref{eg:no-charge-on-interior} on 
p.~\pageref{eg:no-charge-on-interior}.\label{assert-no-charge-on-interior}

      Since wires are good conductors, constancy of potential throughout a conductor provides
      a convenient freedom in hooking up a voltmeter to a circuit. In figure \figref{voltmeter-doesnt-care},
      points B and C are on the same piece of conducting wire, so $V_B=V_C$.

\begin{eg}{The lightning rod}\label{eg:lightning-rod}
 Suppose you have a pear-shaped conductor like the one
        in figure \subfigref{lightning-rod}{1}.  Since the pear is a conductor,
        there are free charges everywhere inside it. Panels 1 and 2 of the figure show
        a computer simulation with 100 identical electric charges. In 1, the charges
        are released at random positions inside the pear. Repulsion causes them all
        to fly outward onto the surface and then settle down into an orderly but nonuniform
        pattern. 

We might not have been able to guess the pattern in advance, but we can
verify that some of its features make sense. For example, charge A has more neighbors
on the right than on the left, which would tend to make it accelerate off to the left.
But when we look at the picture as a whole, it appears reasonable that this is prevented
by the larger number of more distant charges on its left than on its right.

There also seems to be a pattern to the nonuniformity: the charges collect more
densely in areas like B, where the surface is strongly curved, and less densely in flatter areas like C.

  fig(
    'lightning-rod',

    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

To understand the reason for this pattern, consider \subfigref{lightning-rod}{3}.
Two conducting spheres are connected by a conducting wire. Since the whole apparatus
is conducting, it must all be at one potential. As shown in problem \ref{hw:lightning-rod}
on p.~\pageref{hw:lightning-rod}, the density of charge is greater on the smaller
sphere. This is an example of a more general fact observed in \subfigref{lightning-rod}{2}, which is that the charge on
a conductor packs itself more densely in areas that are more sharply curved.

Similar reasoning shows why Benjamin Franklin used a sharp
        tip when he invented the lightning rod. The charged stormclouds
        induce positive and negative charges to move to opposite
        ends of the rod.  At the pointed upper end of the rod, the
        charge tends to concentrate at the point, and this charge
        attracts the lightning. The same effect can sometimes be seen when
        a scrap of aluminum foil is inadvertently put in a microwave oven. Modern experiments (Moore \emph{et al.},
        Journal of Applied Meteorology 39 (1999) 593) show that although
        a sharp tip is best at starting a spark, a more moderate curve,
        like the right-hand tip of the pear in this example, is better
        at successfully sustaining the spark for long enough to connect
        a discharge to the clouds.

At this stage, most students have a hard time understanding
why resistors would be used inside a radio or a computer. We
obviously want a lightbulb or an electric stove to have a
circuit element that resists the flow of electricity and
heats up, but heating is undesirable in radios and
computers. Without going too far afield, let's use a
mechanical analogy to get a general idea of why a resistor
would be used in a radio.

The main parts of a radio receiver are an antenna, a tuner
for selecting the frequency, and an amplifier to strengthen
the signal sufficiently to drive a speaker. The tuner
resonates at the selected frequency, just as in the examples
of mechanical resonance discussed in \ref{ch:3}. The behavior of
a mechanical resonator depends on three things: its inertia,
its stiffness, and the amount of friction or damping. The
first two parameters locate the peak of the resonance curve,
while the damping determines the width of the resonance. In
the radio tuner we have an electrically vibrating system
that resonates at a particular frequency. Instead of a
physical object moving back and forth, these vibrations
consist of electrical currents that flow first in one
direction and then in the other. In a mechanical system,
damping means taking energy out of the vibration in the form
of heat, and exactly the same idea applies to an electrical
system: the resistor supplies the damping, and therefore
controls the width of the resonance. If we set out to
eliminate all resistance in the tuner circuit, by not
building in a resistor and by somehow getting rid of all the
inherent electrical resistance of the wires, we would have a
useless radio. The tuner's resonance would be so narrow that
we could never get close enough to the right frequency to
bring in the station. The roles of inertia and stiffness are
played by other circuit elements we have not discusses (a
capacitor and a coil).

A fuse is a device inserted in a circuit tollbooth-style in
the same manner as an ammeter. It is simply a piece of wire
made of metals having a relatively low melting point. If too
much current passes through the fuse, it melts, opening the
circuit. The purpose is to make sure that the building's
wires do not carry so much current that they themselves will
get hot enough to start a fire. Most modern houses use
circuit breakers instead of fuses, although fuses are still
common in cars and small devices. A circuit breaker is a
switch operated by a coiled-wire magnet, which opens the
circuit when enough current flows. The advantage is that
once you turn off some of the appliances that were sucking
up too much current, you can immediately flip the switch
closed. In the days of fuses, one might get caught without a
replacement fuse, or even be tempted to stuff aluminum foil
in as a replacement, defeating the safety feature.

A voltmeter is nothing more than an ammeter with an
additional high-value resistor through which the current is
also forced to flow. Ohm's law states that the current through
the resistor is related directly to the voltage difference
across it, so the meter can be calibrated in units of volts
based on the known value of the resistor. The voltmeter's
two probes are touched to the two locations in a circuit
between which we wish to measure the voltage difference,
\figref{voltmeter}/2. Note how cumbersome this type of drawing is, and how
difficult it can be to tell what is connected to what. This
is why electrical drawing are usually shown in schematic

The setups for measuring current and voltage are different.
When we are measuring current, we are finding ``how much
stuff goes through,'' so we place the ammeter where all the
current is forced to go through it. Voltage, however, is not
``stuff that goes through,'' it is a measure of electrical
energy. If an ammeter is like the meter that measures your
water use, a voltmeter is like a measuring stick that tells
you how high a waterfall is, so that you can determine how
much energy will be released by each kilogram of falling
water. We do not want to force the water to go through the
measuring stick! The arrangement in figure \figref{voltmeter}/3 is a
$\index{circuit!parallel}\index{parallel circuit!defined}parallel$
circuit: one in there are ``forks in the road'' where some
of the current will flow one way and some will flow the
other. Figure \figref{voltmeter}/4 is said to be wired in 
\index{circuit!series}\index{series
circuit!defined}\emph{series:} all the current will visit all the
circuit elements one after the other. We will deal with
series and parallel circuits in more detail in the following chapter.

If you inserted a voltmeter incorrectly, in series with the
bulb and battery, its large internal resistance would cut
the current down so low that the bulb would go out. You
would have severely disturbed the behavior of the circuit by
trying to measure something about it.

Incorrectly placing an ammeter in parallel is likely to be
even more disconcerting. The ammeter has nothing but wire
inside it to provide resistance, so given the choice, most
of the current will flow through it rather than through the
bulb. So much current will flow through the ammeter, in
fact, that there is a danger of burning out the battery or
the meter or both! For this reason, most ammeters have fuses
or circuit breakers inside. Some models will trip their
circuit breakers and make an audible alarm in this
situation, while others will simply blow a fuse and stop
working until you replace it.

Ohm's law has a remarkable property, which is that current
will flow even in response to a voltage difference that is
as small as we care to make it. In the analogy of pushing a
crate across a floor, it is as though even a flea could
slide the crate across the floor, albeit at some very low
speed. The flea cannot do this because of static friction,
which we can think of as an effect arising from the tendency
of the microscopic bumps and valleys in the crate and floor
to lock together. The fact that Ohm's law holds for nearly
all solids has an interesting interpretation: at least some
of the electrons are not ``locked down'' at all to any specific atom.

More generally we can ask how charge actually flows in
various solids, liquids, and gases. This will lead us to the
explanations of many interesting phenomena, including
lightning, the bluish crust that builds up on the terminals
of car batteries, and the need for electrolytes in sports drinks.

<% begin_sec("Solids") %>

In atomic terms, the defining characteristic of a solid is
that its atoms are packed together, and the nuclei cannot
move very far from their equilibrium positions. It makes
sense, then, that electrons, not ions, would be the charge
carriers when currents flow in solids. This fact was
established experimentally by Tolman and Stewart, in an
experiment in which they spun a large coil of wire and then
abruptly stopped it. They observed a current in the wire
immediately after the coil was stopped, which indicated that
charged particles that were not permanently locked to a
specific atom had continued to move because of their own
inertia, even after the material of the wire in general
stopped. The direction of the current showed that it was
negatively charged particles that kept moving. The current
only lasted for an instant, however; as the negatively
charged particles collected at the downstream end of the
wire, farther particles were prevented joining them due to
their electrical repulsion, as well as the attraction from
the upstream end, which was left with a net positive charge.
Tolman and Stewart were even able to determine the
mass-to-charge ratio of the particles. We need not go into
the details of the analysis here, but particles with high
mass would be difficult to decelerate, leading to a stronger
and longer pulse of current, while particles with high
charge would feel stronger electrical forces decelerating
them, which would cause a weaker and shorter pulse. The
mass-to-charge ratio thus determined was consistent with the
$m/q$ of the electron to within the accuracy of the
experiment, which essentially established that the
particles were electrons.

The fact that only electrons carry current in solids, not
ions, has many important implications. For one thing, it
explains why wires don't fray or turn to dust after carrying
current for a long time. Electrons are very small (perhaps
even pointlike), and it is easy to imagine them passing
between the cracks among the atoms without creating holes or
fractures in the atomic framework. For those who know a
little chemistry, it also explains why all the best
conductors are on the left side of the periodic table. The
elements in that area are the ones that have only a very
loose hold on their outermost electrons.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Gases") %>

The molecules in a gas spend most of their time separated
from each other by significant distances, so it is not
possible for them to conduct electricity the way solids do,
by handing off electrons from atom to atom. It is therefore
not surprising that gases are good insulators.  

Gases are also usually nonohmic. As opposite charges build
up on a stormcloud and the ground below, the voltage
difference becomes greater and greater. Zero
current flows, however, until finally the voltage reaches a
certain threshold and we have an impressive example of what
is known as a spark or electrical discharge. If air was
ohmic, the current between the cloud and the ground would
simply increase steadily as the voltage difference
increased, rather than being zero until a threshold was
reached. This behavior can be explained as follows. At some
point, the electrical forces on the air electrons and nuclei
of the air molecules become so strong that electrons are
ripped right off of some of the molecules. The electrons
then accelerate toward either the cloud or the ground,
whichever is positively charged, and the positive ions
accelerate the opposite way. As these charge carriers
accelerate, they strike and ionize other molecules, which
produces a rapidly growing cascade.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Liquids") %>

Molecules in a liquid are able to slide past each other, so
ions as well as electrons can carry currents. Pure water is
a poor conductor because the water molecules tend to hold
onto their electrons strongly, and there are therefore not
many electrons or ions available to move. Water can become
quite a good conductor, however, with the addition of even a
small amount of certain substances called \index{electrolytes}electrolytes,
which are typically salts. For example, if we add table
salt, NaCl, to water, the NaCl molecules dissolve into Na$^+$
and Cl$^-$ ions, which can then move and create currents.
This is why electric currents can flow among the cells in
our bodies: cellular fluid is quite salty. When we sweat, we
lose not just water but electrolytes, so dehydration plays
havoc with our cells' electrical systems. It is for this
reason that electrolytes are included in sports drinks and
formulas for rehydrating infants who have diarrhea.

Since current flow in liquids involves entire ions, it is
not surprising that we can see physical evidence when it has
occurred. For example, after a car battery has been in use
for a while, the $\zu{H}_2\zu{SO}_4$ battery acid becomes depleted of
hydrogen ions, which are the main charge carriers that
complete the circuit on the inside of the battery. The
leftover $\zu{SO}_4$ then forms a visible blue crust on the battery posts.

<% begin_sec("Speed of currents and electrical signals") %>

When I talk on the phone to my mother in law two thousand
miles away, I do not notice any delay while the signal makes
its way back and forth. Electrical signals therefore must
travel very quickly, but how fast exactly? The answer is
rather subtle. For the sake of concreteness, let's restrict
ourselves to currents in metals, which consist of electrons.

The electrons themselves are only moving at speeds of
perhaps a few thousand miles per hour, and their motion is
mostly random thermal motion. This shows that the electrons
in my phone cannot possibly be zipping back and forth
between California and New York fast enough to carry the
signals. Even if their thousand-mile-an-hour motion was
organized rather than random, it would still take them many
minutes to get there. Realistically, it will take the
average electron even longer than that to make the trip. The
current in the wire consists only of a slow overall drift,
at a speed on the order of a few centimeters per second,
superimposed on the more rapid random motion. We can compare
this with the slow westward drift in the population of the
U.S. If we could make a movie of the motion of all the
people in the U.S. from outer space, and could watch it at
high speed so that the people appeared to be scurrying
around like ants, we would think that the motion was fairly
random, and we would not immediately notice the westward
drift. Only after many years would we realize that the
number of people heading west over the Sierras had exceeded
the number going east, so that California increased its
share of the country's population.

So why are electrical signals so fast if the average drift
speed of electrons is so slow? The answer is that a
disturbance in an electrical system can move much more
quickly than the charges themselves. It is as though we
filled a pipe with golf balls and then inserted an extra
ball at one end, causing a ball to fall out at the other
end. The force propagated to the other end in a fraction of
a second, but the balls themselves only traveled a few
centimeters in that time.

Because the reality of current conduction is so complex, we
often describe things using mental shortcuts that are
technically incorrect. This is OK as long as we know that
they are just shortcuts. For example, suppose the presidents
of France and Russia shake hands, and the French politician
has inadvertently picked up a positive electrical charge,
which shocks the Russian. We may say that the excess
positively charged particles in the French leader's body,
which all repel each other, take the handshake as an
opportunity to get farther apart by spreading out into two
bodies rather than one. In reality, it would be a matter of
minutes before the ions in one person's body could actually
drift deep into the other's. What really happens is that
throughout the body of the recipient of the shock there are
already various positive and negative ions which are free to
move. Even before the perpetrator's charged hand touches the
victim's sweaty palm, the charges in the shocker's body
begin to repel the positive ions and attract the negative
ions in the other person. The split-second sensation of
shock is caused by the sudden jumping of the victim's ions
by distances of perhaps a micrometer, this effect occurring
simultaneously throughout the whole body, although more
violently in the hand and arm, which are closer to the other person.

In section \ref{sec:iv}, we limited ourselves to relatively

An example of an irrelevant feature is the physical shape,
length, and diameter of a wire. In nearly all circuits, it
is a good approximation to assume that the wires are perfect
conductors, so that any piece of wire uninterrupted by other
components has constant voltage throughout it. Changing the
length of the wire, for instance, does not change this fact.
(Of course if we used miles and miles of wire, as in a
telephone line, the wire's resistance would start to add up,
and its length would start to matter.) The shapes of the
wires are likewise irrelevant, so we draw them with
standardized, stylized shapes made only of vertical and
horizontal lines with right-angle bends in them. This has
the effect of making similar circuits look more alike and
helping us to recognize familiar patterns, just as words in
a newspaper are easier to recognize than handwritten ones.
Figure \figref{sample-schematics} shows some examples of these concepts.

The most important first step in learning to read schematics
is to learn to recognize contiguous pieces of wire which
must have constant voltage throughout. In figure \figref{constant-voltage-areas}, for
example, the two shaded E-shaped pieces of wire must each
have constant voltage. This focuses our attention on two of
the main unknowns we'd like to be able to predict: the
voltage of the left-hand E and the voltage of the one on the right.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Parallel resistances and the junction rule") %>

\index{resistance!in parallel}\index{junction rule}

One of the simplest examples to analyze is the parallel
resistance circuit, of which figure \figref{constant-voltage-areas} was an example. In
general we may have unequal resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$, as
in \figref{parallel-resistors}/1. Since there are only two constant-voltage areas in
the circuit, \figref{parallel-resistors}/2, all three components have the same voltage
difference across them. A battery normally succeeds in
maintaining the voltage differences across itself for which
it was designed, so the voltage drops $\Delta V_1$ and
$\Delta V_2$ across the resistors must both equal the
voltage of the battery:
\begin{equation*}
        \Delta V_1=\Delta V_2=\Delta V_{battery}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Each resistance thus feels the same voltage difference as if
it was the only one in the circuit, and Ohm's law tells us
that the amount of current flowing through each one is also
the same as it would have been in a one-resistor circuit.
This is why household electrical circuits are wired in
parallel. We want every appliance to work the same,
regardless of whether other appliances are plugged in or
unplugged, turned on or switched off. (The electric company
doesn't use batteries of course, but our analysis would be
the same for any device that maintains a constant voltage.)

Of course the electric company can tell when we turn on
every light in the house. How do they know? The answer is
that we draw more current. Each resistance draws a certain
amount of current, and the amount that has to be supplied is
the sum of the two individual currents. The current is like
a river that splits in half, \figref{parallel-resistors}/3, and then reunites.
The total current is
\begin{equation*}
                I_{total}         =    I_1 + I_2\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}

This is an example of a general fact called the junction rule:

In any circuit that is not storing or releasing charge, conservation of
charge implies that the total current flowing out of any junction must be the
same as the total flowing in.

Coming back to the analysis of our circuit, we apply Ohm's
law to each resistance, resulting in
\begin{align*}
                I_{total}         &=    \Delta V/R_1+ \Delta V/R_2  \\
                         &=             \Delta V\left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)\eqquad.  
\end{align*}

As far as the electric company is concerned, your whole
house is just one resistor with some resistance $R$, called
the \index{resistors!in parallel}\index{equivalent
resistance!of resistors in parallel}\emph{equivalent resistance}.
They would write Ohm's law as
\begin{equation*}
                        I_{total}         =    \Delta V/R\eqquad,  
\end{equation*}
from which we can determine the equivalent resistance by
comparison with the previous expression:
\begin{align*}
                        1/R         &=   \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}   \\
                          R         &=  \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1}          
\end{align*}
\hfill{}[equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel]

\noindent Two resistors in parallel, \figref{parallel-resistors}/4, are equivalent to a single
resistor with a value given by the above equation.

\begin{eg}{Two lamps on the same household circuit}
\egquestion
You turn on two lamps that are on the same
household circuit. Each one has a resistance of 1 ohm. What
is the equivalent resistance, and how does the power
dissipation compare with the case of a single lamp?

\eganswer
        The equivalent resistance of the two lamps in parallel is
\begin{align*}
                 R         &=    \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \left(\frac{1}{1\ \Omega}+\frac{1}{1\ \Omega}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \left(1\ \Omega^{-1} + 1\ \Omega^{-1}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \left(2\ \Omega^{-1}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \text{0.5}\ \Omega   
\end{align*}
The voltage difference across the whole circuit is always
the 110 V set by the electric company (it's alternating
current, but that's irrelevant). The resistance of the whole
circuit has been cut in half by turning on the second lamp,
so a fixed amount of voltage will produce twice as much
current. Twice the current flowing across the same voltage
difference means twice as much power dissipation, which makes sense.

\end{eg}

The cutting in half of the resistance surprises many
students, since we are ``adding more resistance'' to the
circuit by putting in the second lamp. Why does the
equivalent resistance come out to be less than the
resistance of a single lamp? This is a case where purely
verbal reasoning can be misleading. A resistive circuit
element, such as the filament of a lightbulb, is neither a
perfect insulator nor a perfect conductor. Instead of
analyzing this type of circuit in terms of ``resistors,''
i.e., partial insulators, we could have spoken of ``conductors.''
This example would then seem reasonable, since we ``added
more conductance,'' but one would then have the incorrect
expectation about the case of resistors in series, discussed
in the following section.

Perhaps a more productive way of thinking about it is to use
mechanical intuition. By analogy, your nostrils resist the
flow of air through them, but having two nostrils makes it
twice as easy to breathe.

\begin{eg}{Three resistors in parallel}
\egquestion
What happens if we have three or more resistors in parallel?

\eganswer
        This is an important example, because the solution
involves an important technique for understanding circuits:
breaking them down into smaller parts and them simplifying
those parts. In the circuit \figref{eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/1, with three resistors in
parallel, we can think of two of the resistors as forming a
single big resistor, \figref{eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/2, with equivalent resistance 
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{12}         =    \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}\right)^{-1}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
We can then simplify the circuit as shown in \figref{eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/3, so that it
contains only two resistances. The equivalent resistance of
the whole circuit is then given by
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{123}    =    \left(\frac{1}{ R_{12}}+\frac{1}{ R_3}\right)^{-1}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
Substituting for $R_{12}$ and simplifying, we find the result
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{123}    =  \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}+\frac{1}{ R_3}\right)^{-1}\eqquad,  
\end{equation*}
which you probably could have guessed. The interesting point
here is the divide-and-conquer concept, not the mathematical result.

\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{An arbitrary number of identical resistors in parallel}
\egquestion
What is the resistance of $N$ identical resistors in parallel?

        Generalizing the results for two and three resistors, we have

where ``...'' means that the sum includes all the resistors.
If all the resistors are identical, this becomes
\begin{align*}

we are ready to begin making more mathematical statements

resistors's cross-sectional area is equivalent to adding
more resistors in parallel, which will lead to an overall
decrease in resistance. Any real resistor with straight,
parallel sides can be sliced up into a large number of
pieces, each with cross-sectional area of, say, 1 $\mu \zu{m}^2$.
The number, $N$, of such slices is proportional to the total
cross-sectional area of the resistor, and by application of
the result of the previous example we therefore find that
the resistance of an object is inversely proportional to its
cross-sectional area.

\begin{eg}{Incorrect readings from a voltmeter}
        A voltmeter is really just an ammeter with an internal
resistor, and we use a voltmeter in parallel with the thing
that we're trying to measure the voltage difference across.
This means that any time we measure the voltage drop across
a resistor, we're essentially putting two resistors in
parallel. The ammeter inside the voltmeter can be ignored
for the purpose of analyzing what how current flows in the
circuit, since it is essentially just some coiled-up wire
with a very low resistance.

        Now if we are carrying out this measurement on a resistor
that is part of a larger circuit, we have changed the
behavior of the circuit through our act of measuring. It is
as though we had modified the circuit by replacing the
resistance $R$ with the smaller equivalent resistance of $R$
and $R_v$ in parallel. It is for this reason that voltmeters
are built with the largest possible internal resistance. As
a numerical example, if we use a voltmeter with an internal
resistance of 1 $\zu{M}\Omega $ to measure the voltage drop
across a one-ohm resistor, the equivalent resistance is
0.999999 $\Omega $, which is not different enough to make
any difference. But if we tried to use the same voltmeter to
measure the voltage drop across a $2-M\Omega $ resistor, we
would be reducing the resistance of that part of the circuit
by a factor of three, which would produce a drastic change
in the behavior of the whole circuit.
\end{eg}

        This is the reason why you can't use a voltmeter to measure
the voltage difference between two different points in
mid-air, or between the ends of a piece of wood. This is by
no means a stupid thing to want to do, since the world
around us is not a constant-voltage environment, the most
extreme example being when an electrical storm is brewing.
But it will not work with an ordinary voltmeter because the
resistance of the air or the wood is many gigaohms. The
effect of waving a pair of voltmeter probes around in the
air is that we provide a reuniting path for the positive and
negative charges that have been separated --- through the
voltmeter itself, which is a good conductor compared to the
air. This reduces to zero the voltage difference we
were trying to measure.

        In general, a voltmeter that has been set up with an open
circuit (or a very large resistance) between its probes is
said to be ``floating.'' An old-fashioned analog voltmeter
of the type described here will read zero when left
floating, the same as when it was sitting on the shelf. A
floating digital voltmeter usually shows an error message.

The two basic circuit layouts are parallel and series, so a
pair of resistors in series, \figref{seriesresistors}/1, is another of the most
basic circuits we can make. By conservation of charge, all
the current that flows through one resistor must also flow
through the other (as well as through the battery):
\begin{equation*}
                I_1    =    I_2\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
The only way the information about the two resistance values
is going to be useful is if we can apply Ohm's law, which
will relate the resistance of each resistor to the current
flowing through it and the voltage difference across it.
Figure \figref{seriesresistors}/2 shows the three constant-voltage areas. Voltage
differences are more physically significant than voltages,
so we define symbols for the voltage differences across the
two resistors in figure \figref{seriesresistors}/3.

\enlargethispage{-2\baselineskip}

We have three constant-voltage areas, with symbols for the
difference in voltage between every possible pair of them.
These three voltage differences must be related to each
other. It is as though I tell you that Fred is a foot taller
than Ginger, Ginger is a foot taller than Sally, and Fred is
two feet taller than Sally. The information is redundant,
and you really only needed two of the three pieces of data
to infer the third. In the case of our voltage differences, we have
\begin{equation*}
           |\Delta V_1| + |\Delta V_2| = |\Delta V_{battery}|\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The absolute value signs are because of the ambiguity in how
we define our voltage differences. If we reversed the two
probes of the voltmeter, we would get a result with the
opposite sign. Digital voltmeters will actually provide a
minus sign on the screen if the wire connected to the ``V''
plug is lower in voltage than the one connected to the
``COM'' plug. Analog voltmeters pin the needle against a peg
if you try to use them to measure negative voltages, so you
have to fiddle to get the leads connected the right way, and
then supply any necessary minus sign yourself.

Figure \figref{seriesresistors}/4 shows a standard way of taking care of the
ambiguity in signs. For each of the three voltage measurements
around the loop, we keep the same probe (the darker one) on
the clockwise side. It is as though the voltmeter was
sidling around the circuit like a crab, without ever
``crossing its legs.'' With this convention, the relationship
among the voltage drops becomes
\begin{equation*}
          \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 = -\Delta V_{battery}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
or, in more symmetrical form,
\begin{equation*}
          \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
More generally, this is known as the loop rule for analyzing circuits:

Assuming the standard convention for plus and minus signs, the sum of the
voltage drops around any closed loop in a DC circuit must be zero.

\enlargethispage{-2\baselineskip}

Looking for an exception to the \index{loop rule}loop rule
would be like asking for a hike that would be downhill all
the way and that would come back to its starting point!

        For the circuit we set out to analyze, the equation
\begin{equation*}
          \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0
\end{equation*}
can now be rewritten by applying Ohm's law to each resistor:
\begin{equation*}
          I_1R_1 + I_2R_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The currents are the same, so we can factor them out:
\begin{equation*}
          I\left(R_1 + R_2\right) + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
and this is the same result we would have gotten if we had
been analyzing a one-resistor circuit with resistance
$R_1+R_2$. Thus the equivalent resistance of resistors in
series equals the sum of their resistances.

\begin{eg}{Two lightbulbs in series}\label{eg:two-bulbs-in-series}
\egquestion
If two identical  lightbulbs are placed in series,
how do their brightnesses compare with the brightness of a single bulb?

\eganswer
        Taken as a whole, the pair of bulbs act like a
doubled resistance, so they will draw half as much current
from the wall. Each bulb will be dimmer than a single
bulb would have been.

The total power dissipated by the circuit is $I\Delta V$.
        The voltage drop across the whole circuit is the same as
        before, but the current is halved, so the two-bulb circuit
        draws half as much total power as the one-bulb circuit. Each
        bulb draws one-quarter of the normal power.

        Roughly speaking, we might expect this to result in one
quarter the light being produced by each bulb, but in
reality lightbulbs waste quite a high percentage of their
power in the form of heat and wavelengths of light that are
not visible (infrared and ultraviolet). Less light will be
produced, but it's hard to predict exactly how much less,
since the efficiency of the bulbs will be changed by
operating them under different conditions.

\begin{eg}{More than two equal resistances in series}
By straightforward application of the divide-and-conquer
technique discussed in the previous section, we find that
the equivalent resistance of $N$ identical resistances $R$
in series will be $NR$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Dependence of resistance on length}
In the previous section, we proved that resistance is
inversely proportional to cross-sectional area. By
equivalent reason about resistances in series, we find that
resistance is proportional to length. Analogously, it is
harder to blow through a long straw than through a short one.
\end{eg}

        Putting the two arguments together, we find that the
resistance of an object with straight, parallel sides is given by
\begin{equation*}
                         R    =    \text{(constant)} \cdot  L/ A  
\end{equation*}
The proportionality constant is called the \index{resistivity!defined}resistivity,
and it depends only on the substance of which the object is
made. A resistivity measurement could be used, for instance,
to help identify a sample of an unknown substance.

\begin{eg}{Choice of high voltage for power lines}\label{hvtransmission}
        Thomas Edison got involved in a famous technological
controversy over the voltage difference that should be used
for electrical power lines. At this time, the public was
unfamiliar with electricity, and easily scared by it. The
president of the United States, for instance, refused to
have electrical lighting in the White House when it first
became commercially available because he considered it
unsafe, preferring the known fire hazard of oil lamps to the
mysterious dangers of electricity. Mainly as a way to
overcome public fear, Edison believed that power should be
transmitted using small voltages, and he publicized his
opinion by giving demonstrations at which a dog was lured
into position to be killed by a large voltage difference
between two sheets of metal on the ground. (Edison's
opponents also advocated alternating current rather than
direct current, and AC is more dangerous than DC as well. As
we will discuss later, AC can be easily stepped up and down
to the desired voltage level using a device called a transformer.)

                Now if we want to deliver a certain amount of power $P_L$ to
a load such as an electric lightbulb, we are constrained
only by the equation $P_{L} =  I\Delta  V_L$. We can deliver any
amount of power we wish, even with a low voltage, if we are
willing to use large currents. Modern electrical distribution
networks, however, use dangerously high voltage differences
of tens of thousands of volts. Why did Edison lose the debate?    

        It boils down to money. The electric company must deliver
the amount of power $P_L$ desired by the customer through a
transmission line whose resistance $R_T$ is fixed by
economics and geography. The same current flows through both
the load and the transmission line, dissipating power
usefully in the former and wastefully in the latter. The
efficiency of the system is
\begin{align*}
                \text{efficiency}         &=   \frac{\text{power paid for by the customer}}
                                                                        {\text{power paid for by the utility}}   \\
                                 &=  \frac{ P_{L}}{ P_L+ P_{T}}    \\
                                 &=   \frac{1}{1+ P_{T}/ P_L}   
\end{align*}
Putting ourselves in the shoes of the electric company, we
wish to get rid of the variable $P_T$, since it is something
we control only indirectly by our choice of $\Delta  V_T$ and
$I$. Substituting $P_{T}= I\Delta  V_T$, we find
\begin{equation*}
                \text{efficiency}         =      \frac{1}
                                                {1+\frac{ I \Delta V_T}{ P_L}}
\end{equation*}
We assume the transmission line (but not necessarily the
load) is ohmic, so substituting $\Delta V_T=IR_T$ gives
\begin{equation*}
                efficiency         =      \frac{1}{1+\frac{I^2R_T}{P_L}}
\end{equation*}
This quantity can clearly be maximized by making $I$ as
small as possible, since we will then be dividing by the
smallest possible quantity on the bottom of the fraction. A
low-current circuit can only deliver significant amounts of
power if it uses high voltages, which is why electrical
transmission systems use dangerous high voltages.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Getting killed by your ammeter}
        As with a voltmeter, an ammeter can give erroneous readings
if it is used in such a way that it changes the behavior the
circuit. An ammeter is used in series, so if it is used to
measure the current through a resistor, the resistor's value
will effectively be changed to $R+ R_a$, where $R_a$ is the
resistance of the ammeter. Ammeters are designed with very
low resistances in order to make it unlikely that $R+ R_a$
will be significantly different from $R$.

        In fact, the real hazard is death, not a wrong reading!
Virtually the only circuits whose resistances are significantly
less than that of an ammeter are those designed to carry
huge currents. An ammeter inserted in such a circuit can
easily melt. When I was working at a laboratory funded by
the Department of Energy, we got periodic bulletins from the
DOE safety office about serious accidents at other sites,
and they held a certain ghoulish fascination. One of these
was about a DOE worker who was completely incinerated by the
explosion created when he inserted an ordinary Radio Shack
ammeter into a high-current circuit. Later estimates showed
that the heat was probably so intense that the explosion was
a ball of plasma --- a gas so hot that its atoms have been ionized.

\begin{eg}{A complicated circuit}\label{eg:close-switch}
\egquestion
All seven resistors in the left-hand panel of figure \figref{eg-close-switch} are identical.
Initially, the switch S is open as shown in the figure, and the current through resistor A is $I_\zu{o}$.
The switch is then closed. Find the current through resistor B, after the switch is closed, in terms of $I_\zu{o}$.

\eganswer
The second panel shows the circuit redrawn for simplicity, in the initial condition with the switch open.
When the switch is open, no current can flow through the central resistor, so we may as well ignore it.
I've also redrawn the junctions, without changing what's connected to what. This is the kind of mental
rearranging that you'll eventually learn to do automatically from experience with analyzing circuits.
The redrawn version makes it easier to see what's happening with the current. Charge is conserved, so
any charge that flows past point 1 in the circuit must also flow past points 2 and 3. This would have
been harder to reason about by applying the junction rule to the original version, which appears to have nine separate junctions.

In the new version, it's also clear that the circuit has a great deal of symmetry. We could flip over each
parallel pair of identical resistors without changing what's connected to what, so that makes it clear that the voltage
drops and currents must be equal for the members of each pair. We can also prove this by using the loop rule.
The loop rule says that the two voltage drops in loop 4 must be equal, and similarly for loops 5 and 6.
Since the resistors obey Ohm's law, equal voltage drops across them also imply equal currents. That means
that when the current at point 1 comes to the top junction, exactly half of it goes through each resistor. Then
the current reunites at 2, splits between the next pair, and so on. We conclude that each of the six resistors
in the circuit experiences the same voltage drop and the same current. Applying the loop rule to loop 7, we
find that the sum of the three voltage drops across the three left-hand resistors equals the battery's
voltage, $V$, so each resistor in the circuit experiences a voltage drop $V/3$. Letting $R$ stand for
the resistance of one of the resistors, we find that the current through resistor B, which is the same
as the currents through all the others, is given by $I_\zu{o}=V/3R$.

We now pass to the case where the switch is closed, as shown in the third panel. The battery's voltage is
the same as before, and each resistor's resistance is the same, so we can still use the same symbols
$V$ and $R$ for them. It is no longer true, however, that each resistor feels a voltage drop $V/3$.
The equivalent resistance of the whole circuit is $R/2+R/3+R/2=4R/3$, so the total current drawn from
the battery is $3V/4R$. In the middle group of resistors, this current is split three ways, so the new current
through B is $(1/3)(3V/4R)=V/4R=3I_\zu{o}/4$.

Interpreting this result, we see that it comes from two effects that partially cancel.
Closing the switch reduces the equivalent resistance of the circuit by giving charge another
way to flow, and increases the amount of current drawn from the battery. Resistor B, however,
only gets a 1/3 share of this greater current, not 1/2. The second effect turns out to be
bigger than the first, and therefore the current through resistor B is lessened
over all.

\end{eg}

\startdq

\begin{dq}
        We have stated the loop rule in a symmetric form where a
        series of voltage drops adds up to zero. To do this, we had
        to define a standard way of connecting the voltmeter to the
        circuit so that the plus and minus signs would come out
        right. Suppose we wish to restate the junction rule in a
        similar symmetric way, so that instead of equating the
        current coming in to the current going out, it simply states
        that a certain sum of currents at a junction adds up to
        zero. What standard way of inserting the ammeter would we
        have to use to make this work?

\noindent Apparatus:

\begin{indentedblock}
DC power supply

multimeter

resistors
\end{indentedblock}

1. The junction rule

Construct a circuit like this one, using the power supply as
your voltage source. To make things more interesting, don't
use equal resistors. Use nice big resistors (say 100
$k\Omega $ to 1 $M\Omega $) --- this will ensure that you
don't burn up the resistors, and that the multimeter's small
internal resistance when used as an ammeter is negligible in comparison.  

\hspace{20mm}\anonymousinlinefig{ex-kirchof-circuit}

Insert your multimeter in the circuit to measure all three
currents that you need in order to test the junction rule.

2. The loop rule

Now come up with a circuit to test the loop rule. Since the
loop rule is always supposed to be true, it's hard to go
wrong here! Make sure you have at least three resistors in a
loop, and make sure you hook in the power supply in a way
that creates non-zero voltage differences across all the
resistors. Measure the voltage differences you need to
measure to test the loop rule. Here it is best to use fairly
small resistances, so that the multimeter's large internal
resistance when used in parallel as a voltmeter will not
significantly reduce the resistance of the circuit. Do not
use resistances of less than about 100 $\Omega $, however,
or you may blow a fuse or burn up a resistor.

\extitle{C}{Reasoning About Circuits}

The questions in this exercise can all be solved using some
combination of the following approaches:

\begin{indentedblock}
a) There is constant voltage throughout any conductor.

b) Ohm's law can be applied to any \emph{part} of a circuit.

c) Apply the loop rule.

d) Apply the junction rule.
\end{indentedblock}

In each case, discuss the question, decide what you think is
the right answer, and then try the experiment.

1. A wire is added in parallel with one bulb.  

\hspace{20mm}\anonymousinlinefig{ex-circuits-1}

Which reasoning is correct?

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{ Each bulb still has 1.2 V across it, so both bulbs are still lit up.}

\item \emph{All parts of a wire are at the same voltage, and there is
now a wire connection from one side of the right-hand bulb
to the other.  The right-hand bulb has no voltage difference
across it, so it goes out.}
\end{itemize}

2. The series circuit is changed as shown.

\hspace{20mm}\anonymousinlinefig{ex-circuits-2}

Which reasoning is correct?

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Each bulb now has its sides connected to the two terminals
of the battery, so each now has 2.4 V across it instead of
1.2 V.  They get brighter.}

\item \emph{Just as in the original circuit, the current goes through
one bulb, then the other.  It's just that now the current
goes in a  figure-8 pattern.  The bulbs glow the same as before. }
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak[4]

3. A wire is added as shown to the original circuit.

\hspace{20mm}\anonymousinlinefig{ex-circuits-3}

What is wrong with the following reasoning?

\emph{The top right bulb will go out, because its two sides are
now connected with wire, so there will be no voltage
difference across it.  The other three bulbs will not be affected.}

4. A wire is added as shown to the original circuit.

   \hspace{20mm}\anonymousinlinefig{ex-circuits-4}

What is wrong with the following reasoning?

\emph{The current flows out of the right side of the battery. When
it hits the first junction, some of it will go left and some
will keep going up  The part that goes up lights the top
right bulb.  The part that turns left then follows the path
of least resistance, going through the new wire instead of
the bottom bulb. The top bulb stays lit, the bottom one goes
out, and others stay the same.  }

5. What happens when one bulb is unscrewed, leaving an air gap?
