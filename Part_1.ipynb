       "- Time span for the simulation (e.g., t ∈ [0, T_end]): not specified.\n",
       "  - Must ask the user. A typical choice could be to cover several periods, but we cannot assume this.\n",
       "- Desired output sampling or resolution (e.g., number of points or time step), or whether adaptive steps with dense\n",
       "output are acceptable: not specified.\n",
       "  - Must ask the user. If not specified, we can use an adaptive solver with default tolerances and a reasonable \n",

       "  - Not required, but could be useful to verify the numerical solution; ask user if they want this comparison.\n",

       "### 1.3. Facts to derive\n",
       "- Equation of motion (assuming no damping/driving unless the user specifies otherwise):\n",
       "  - m x'' + k x = 0 → x'' + (k/m) x = 0.\n",
       "  - This follows from Newton’s second law for a mass attached to an ideal spring.\n",
       "- State-space form for numerical integration:\n",
       "  - Let y = [x, v], then y' = [v, -(k/m) x].\n",
       "  - This is required by standard ODE integrators (e.g., RK methods) which operate on first-order systems.\n",
       "- Natural frequency and period (useful for choosing a suitable time span and for validation):\n",
       "  - ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(4/1) = 2 rad/s.\n",
       "  - Period T = 2π/ω = 2π/2 = π seconds.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: For an undamped simple harmonic oscillator, the solution is sinusoidal with these parameters.\n",
       "- Analytical solution (for validation once v(0) is known):\n",
       "  - x(t) = A cos(ω t) + B sin(ω t), with A = x(0) and B = v(0)/ω.\n",
       "  - This can be used to verify the numerical solution by comparing at sampled times.\n",
       "- Numerical method considerations:\n",
       "  - An adaptive Runge–Kutta method (e.g., RK45) is appropriate, stable, and efficient for smooth oscillatory \n",
       "solutions.\n",
       "  - Output can be requested at a uniform grid over the time span for plotting and for returning x(t) arrays.\n",
       "  - Tolerances (rtol, atol) should be chosen to ensure phase accuracy over many periods; if the user requests a \n",
       "long time span, tighter tolerances may be needed to control phase drift.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Plan\n",
       "1. Use ask_user to collect missing problem specifications:\n",
       "   - Initial velocity v(0).\n",

       "if so, request coefficients/forcing.\n",
       "   - Desired simulation time span [0, T_end].\n",
       "   - Desired sampling (number of points or time step) or consent to use adaptive solver with a reasonable \n",
       "evaluation grid.\n",
       "   - Preference for including a plot (IPython) and any output formatting preferences (arrays, CSV, etc.).\n",
       "2. Define the ODE system based on the user’s damping/driving inputs:\n",
       "   - If undamped and unforced, use y' = [v, -(k/m) x].\n",
       "   - If damping/driving is specified, include those terms accordingly (e.g., c v, F(t)/m).\n",
       "3. Set up the numerical solver configuration:\n",
       "   - Choose an adaptive Runge–Kutta method (e.g., RK45) with appropriate rtol/atol (default or user-specified).\n",
       "   - Construct the evaluation time grid over [0, T_end] for returning x(t) (uniform grid for plotting).\n",
       "4. Run the numerical integration over the specified time span with initial conditions [x(0)=1, v(0)=user_value].\n",
       "5. (Optional but recommended) Validate by computing the analytical solution for the undamped, unforced case using ω\n",
       "= sqrt(k/m) and compare numerically (max error over the grid). If discrepancies exceed tolerance, adjust solver \n",
       "tolerances and re-run.\n",
       "6. Prepare deliverables:\n",
       "   - Provide t and x(t) arrays (and v(t) if helpful).\n",
       "   - Provide an interpolation function or instructions for evaluating x(t) at arbitrary times using the solver’s \n",
       "dense output.\n",
       "   - Include an IPython plotting snippet showing x(t) vs t with labels and units.\n",

       "  - Let y = [x, v], then y' = [v, -(k/m) x].\n",

       "### 1.2. Facts to look up\n",
       "- Definition/units of “Ton” intended by the user:\n",
       "  - Options: metric tonne (1,000 kg), short ton (2,000 lb ≈ 907.185 kg), long ton (2,240 lb ≈ 1,016.047 kg).\n",
       "  - Where: ask the user.\n",
       "- Interpretation of “out of the earth”:\n",
       "  - Options: escape Earth’s gravity to infinity (escape energy), reach “space” (e.g., 100 km), reach low Earth \n",
       "orbit (LEO), or reach a particular altitude.\n",
       "  - Where: ask the user.\n",
       "- Modeling assumptions:\n",
       "  - Whether to ignore atmospheric drag and gravity losses; whether to include Earth’s rotation; starting \n",
       "altitude/latitude; whether to calculate ideal mechanical energy only.\n",
       "  - Where: ask the user.\n",
       "- Physical constants (if computing ideal energy):\n",
       "  - Earth’s gravitational parameter μ = GM_earth.\n",
       "  - Earth’s mean radius R_earth.\n",
       "  - Escape velocity at Earth’s surface v_escape = sqrt(2μ/R_earth) (equivalently usable).\n",
       "  - Where: an introductory physics reference (via query_book) or authoritative sources (NASA fact sheet, NIST, \n",
       "Wikipedia).\n",
       "- Unit conversions for presentation:\n",
       "  - Joules to kilowatt-hours (kWh).\n",
       "  - Possibly to “tons of TNT” equivalent, if desired for context.\n",
       "  - Where: physics reference or standard conversion tables.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1.3. Facts to derive\n",
       "- Mass of the rocket in kilograms:\n",
       "  - From the user’s intended “Ton” definition. For example, if 100 metric tonnes, m = 100 × 1,000 kg = 100,000 kg. \n",
       "Reasoning: energy formulas require SI mass units.\n",
       "- Ideal mechanical energy to escape Earth’s gravity from the surface (ignoring atmosphere and rotation):\n",
       "  - ΔU_to_infinity = μ m / R_earth, equivalently E = (1/2) m v_escape^2.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: gravitational potential energy relative to infinity is U = −μ m / r; at r = R_earth, raising to r → \n",
       "∞ requires +μ m / R_earth of energy (ignoring losses).\n",
       "- If the user means “reach space” (e.g., 100 km altitude) but not escape:\n",
       "  - ΔU = μ m (1/R_earth − 1/(R_earth + 100 km)).\n",
       "  - Reasoning: difference in gravitational potential energy between two radii.\n",
       "- If the user means “reach LEO”:\n",
       "  - Orbital specific energy ε = −μ/(2a); circular LEO at radius r ≈ R_earth + h has specific kinetic energy v^2/2 \n",
       "with v = sqrt(μ/r). Total mechanical energy per mass is −μ/(2r), so the energy to go from rest at surface to LEO \n",
       "(ideal) is approximately:\n",
       "    - ΔU (surface to r) + orbital kinetic energy at r: μ(1/R_earth − 1/r) + (1/2) v^2, all multiplied by m.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: reaching orbit requires both gaining altitude (potential energy) and acquiring orbital kinetic \n",
       "energy.\n",
       "- Optional corrections or comparisons (only if user requests):\n",
       "  - Effect of Earth’s rotation: subtract rotational kinetic energy at launch latitude from required energy.\n",
       "  - Realistic rocket losses: gravity drag and atmospheric drag substantially increase actual propulsive energy \n",
       "beyond ideal mechanical energy; would require trajectory assumptions and/or typical loss budgets.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Plan\n",
       "1) Ask the user to clarify:\n",
       "   - Which “Ton” unit to use (metric tonne, short ton, or long ton)?\n",
       "   - What “out of the earth” means in this context: escape Earth’s gravity to infinity, reach a specific altitude \n",
       "(e.g., 100 km), or reach a specific orbit (e.g., LEO)?\n",
       "   - Whether to ignore atmosphere, gravity losses, and Earth’s rotation (i.e., compute ideal mechanical energy), or\n",
       "include some/all of these effects.\n",
       "   - Preferred units for the final answer (J, kWh, etc.) and whether they want a visualization.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Based on the user’s answers, look up needed constants using a physics reference:\n",
       "   - Earth’s gravitational parameter μ.\n",
       "   - Earth’s mean radius R_earth.\n",
       "   - (Optionally) escape velocity v_escape.\n",
       "   - Confirm unit conversions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Convert the rocket mass into kilograms using the clarified Ton definition.\n",
       "\n",
       "4) Compute the required energy for the clarified target:\n",
       "   - If escape to infinity (ideal): E = μ m / R_earth (or E = 0.5 m v_escape^2).\n",
       "   - If a finite altitude: ΔU = μ m (1/R_earth − 1/(R_earth + h)).\n",
       "   - If LEO: ΔU (surface→r) + 0.5 m (μ/r) for orbital kinetic energy.\n",
       "\n",
       "5) If the user asked to include Earth’s rotation: subtract the surface rotational kinetic energy at the given \n",
       "latitude from the requirement. If they asked to include atmospheric and gravity losses: add standard loss estimates\n",
       "or discuss required trajectory modeling and provide a range.\n",
       "\n",
       "6) Present the numerical result in requested units, plus a concise explanation of assumptions. If requested, \n",
       "include an IPython visualization of gravitational potential energy versus radius and annotate the computed \n",
       "point(s).\n",

       "Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\n",
       "```\n",
       "### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n",
       "- Object: a “100-Ton rocket.”\n",
       "- Goal phrase: “lift … out of the earth.”\n",
       "- No starting location specified (e.g., sea level), no trajectory or altitude target specified, no losses (drag, \n",
       "gravity losses) specified, and no rotation effects specified.\n",
       "- No unit system specified for “Ton” (metric tonne, short ton, or long ton).\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1.2. Facts to look up\n",
       "- Definition/units of “Ton” intended by the user:\n",
       "  - Options: metric tonne (1,000 kg), short ton (2,000 lb ≈ 907.185 kg), long ton (2,240 lb ≈ 1,016.047 kg).\n",
       "  - Where: ask the user.\n",
       "- Interpretation of “out of the earth”:\n",
       "  - Options: escape Earth’s gravity to infinity (escape energy), reach “space” (e.g., 100 km), reach low Earth \n",
       "orbit (LEO), or reach a particular altitude.\n",
       "  - Where: ask the user.\n",
       "- Modeling assumptions:\n",
       "  - Whether to ignore atmospheric drag and gravity losses; whether to include Earth’s rotation; starting \n",
       "altitude/latitude; whether to calculate ideal mechanical energy only.\n",
       "  - Where: ask the user.\n",
       "- Physical constants (if computing ideal energy):\n",
       "  - Earth’s gravitational parameter μ = GM_earth.\n",
       "  - Earth’s mean radius R_earth.\n",
       "  - Escape velocity at Earth’s surface v_escape = sqrt(2μ/R_earth) (equivalently usable).\n",
       "  - Where: an introductory physics reference (via query_book) or authoritative sources (NASA fact sheet, NIST, \n",
       "Wikipedia).\n",
       "- Unit conversions for presentation:\n",
       "  - Joules to kilowatt-hours (kWh).\n",
       "  - Possibly to “tons of TNT” equivalent, if desired for context.\n",
       "  - Where: physics reference or standard conversion tables.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1.3. Facts to derive\n",
       "- Mass of the rocket in kilograms:\n",
       "  - From the user’s intended “Ton” definition. For example, if 100 metric tonnes, m = 100 × 1,000 kg = 100,000 kg. \n",
       "Reasoning: energy formulas require SI mass units.\n",
       "- Ideal mechanical energy to escape Earth’s gravity from the surface (ignoring atmosphere and rotation):\n",
       "  - ΔU_to_infinity = μ m / R_earth, equivalently E = (1/2) m v_escape^2.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: gravitational potential energy relative to infinity is U = −μ m / r; at r = R_earth, raising to r → \n",
       "∞ requires +μ m / R_earth of energy (ignoring losses).\n",
       "- If the user means “reach space” (e.g., 100 km altitude) but not escape:\n",
       "  - ΔU = μ m (1/R_earth − 1/(R_earth + 100 km)).\n",
       "  - Reasoning: difference in gravitational potential energy between two radii.\n",
       "- If the user means “reach LEO”:\n",
       "  - Orbital specific energy ε = −μ/(2a); circular LEO at radius r ≈ R_earth + h has specific kinetic energy v^2/2 \n",
       "with v = sqrt(μ/r). Total mechanical energy per mass is −μ/(2r), so the energy to go from rest at surface to LEO \n",
       "(ideal) is approximately:\n",
       "    - ΔU (surface to r) + orbital kinetic energy at r: μ(1/R_earth − 1/r) + (1/2) v^2, all multiplied by m.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: reaching orbit requires both gaining altitude (potential energy) and acquiring orbital kinetic \n",
       "energy.\n",
       "- Optional corrections or comparisons (only if user requests):\n",
       "  - Effect of Earth’s rotation: subtract rotational kinetic energy at launch latitude from required energy.\n",
       "  - Realistic rocket losses: gravity drag and atmospheric drag substantially increase actual propulsive energy \n",
       "beyond ideal mechanical energy; would require trajectory assumptions and/or typical loss budgets.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 2. Plan\n",
       "1) Ask the user to clarify:\n",
       "   - Which “Ton” unit to use (metric tonne, short ton, or long ton)?\n",
       "   - What “out of the earth” means in this context: escape Earth’s gravity to infinity, reach a specific altitude \n",
       "(e.g., 100 km), or reach a specific orbit (e.g., LEO)?\n",
       "   - Whether to ignore atmosphere, gravity losses, and Earth’s rotation (i.e., compute ideal mechanical energy), or\n",
       "include some/all of these effects.\n",
       "   - Preferred units for the final answer (J, kWh, etc.) and whether they want a visualization.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Based on the user’s answers, look up needed constants using a physics reference:\n",
       "   - Earth’s gravitational parameter μ.\n",
       "   - Earth’s mean radius R_earth.\n",
       "   - (Optionally) escape velocity v_escape.\n",
       "   - Confirm unit conversions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Convert the rocket mass into kilograms using the clarified Ton definition.\n",
       "\n",
       "4) Compute the required energy for the clarified target:\n",
       "   - If escape to infinity (ideal): E = μ m / R_earth (or E = 0.5 m v_escape^2).\n",
       "   - If a finite altitude: ΔU = μ m (1/R_earth − 1/(R_earth + h)).\n",
       "   - If LEO: ΔU (surface→r) + 0.5 m (μ/r) for orbital kinetic energy.\n",
       "\n",
       "5) If the user asked to include Earth’s rotation: subtract the surface rotational kinetic energy at the given \n",
       "latitude from the requirement. If they asked to include atmospheric and gravity losses: add standard loss estimates\n",
       "or discuss required trajectory modeling and provide a range.\n",
       "\n",
       "6) Present the numerical result in requested units, plus a concise explanation of assumptions. If requested, \n",
       "include an IPython visualization of gravitational potential energy versus radius and annotate the computed \n",
       "point(s).\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",

       "- Air density (ρ) corresponding to driving conditions (altitude, temperature, pressure, humidity).\n",
       "  - Where to find: Standard atmosphere tables (sea-level ISA ρ ≈ 1.225 kg/m³), NOAA calculator, engineering \n",
       "handbooks; or compute from user-provided ambient conditions.\n",
       "- Confirmation that “considering aerodynamic drag” means ignoring other resistive forces and efficiencies (or, if \n",

       "  - Reasoning: Standard drag equation for bluff bodies in steady flow.\n",
       "- Aerodynamic power required: P = Fd × v = 0.5 × ρ × Cd × A × v³.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: Power is force times velocity; with drag force above.\n",
       "- Total energy over time t at constant speed: E = P × t = 0.5 × ρ × Cd × A × v³ × t.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: For steady conditions, energy is the time integral of power.\n",

       "  - Reasoning: Needed to express results in common energy units.\n",
       "- Optional sensitivity analysis:\n",
       "  - Compute E over plausible ranges of Cd and A (or CdA) for different Model 3 variants or uncertainties in \n",
       "sources.\n",
       "  - Reasoning: Cd and A vary by trim/year; air density varies with ambient conditions; presenting a range yields a \n",
